alive hernando replied legalistic argument selfdefense accused one native chief burned death scoundrel stood around awkwardly bit de soto allegedly superior diplomat noticed emperor atahualpa seemed purposefully avoiding looking horse despite mindblowing must de soto decided get attention making horse rear back hind leg stomp ground great snort amazingly atahualpa didnt budge look horse bunch royal bodyguard freaked ran away later day would put death emperor cowardice many cinematic moment last day inca whole negotiation feel like something written movie word exchanged hernando pizarro invited emperor meet francisco pizarro cajamarca next day emperor atahualpa assented spaniard left told advisor meeting solidified plan capture castrate spaniard also capture breed horse hernando pizarro de soto translator got back camp reported francisco pizzaro diplomatic mission gone great oldest pizarro lieutenant spent harrowing night trying figure fuck thought emperor might come visit requested likely would attack killcapture spaniard considered slipping night head back coast reinforcement better opportunity fight worried theyd attacked retreat plus would cowardly finally figured best shot fame glory importantly survival bring old cortes playbook try capture incan emperor maybe pizarro could negotiate emperor get access capital like cortes done maybe emperor really would dumb enough visit cajamarca could launch ambush granted outnumbered something like soldier spaniard aware odds great still best prepare battle disposal spaniard horse canon fewer dozen harquebus decent defensive position city center could form chokepoint narrow road use stone house cover still super optimistic technological geographic advantage could overcome x manpower disadvantage many spaniard assumed would soon die spent night praying christian god entire incan army left camp marched cajamarca stopped almost sundown incan army didnt march fight night pizarro spanish didnt know tactically suboptimal stratagem couldnt figure emperor setting battle plotting something psyching spanish better idea pizarro took lowrisk longshot tactic deploying emissary reiterate invitation incan emperor

man army contingent riding atop litter carried elite noble empire equivalent prince duke town center extremely crowded especially since two entrancesexits incan side according one reddit poster entire incan army unarmed sort show strength macquarrie never say anything spaniard knew fight street mostly likely going try another lowrisk longshot tactic first priest traveling spanish army approached asked emperor atahualpa join pizarro one nearby stone building spaniard planned immediately grab emperor kill bodyguard emperor wisely refused expected priest time shine got chance read requirement

single black slave spanishnative warfare fascinated spanish conquistador fascinated warfare possible soldier defeat soldier isnt myth doesnt seem exaggeration number corroborated dozen spaniard incan primary secondary source wasnt fluke many battle similarly lopsided manpower casualty ratio throughout conquest particularly mexico cortes force often harried native army rare exception spanish lost encounter ambushed extremely outnumbered like la noche triste aztec army besieged cortes within mexican capital every single open engagement spanish native force spanish always dramatically fewer casualty despite absurdly outnumbered reading massive spanish military advantage explained two primary factor technology tactic technology might seem obvious spanish leveraged technology achieve incredible military victory inca aztec ive actually seen pushback point often pointed spanish didnt many piece advanced technology gun cannon foot soldier didnt close full plate armor badhistory subreddit highly voted often referenced ninepart series cortes conquest aztec argues among many thing spanish military superiority highly overrated yes post one reason im writing whole essay someone wrong internet macquarrie better job describing spanish trounced inca bernal dia aztec macquarries telling single impactful element spanish military technology cavalry inca simply could beat armored soldier armored horse open combat especially charged lance inca tried many tactic cavalry including swarming barricade missile barrage nothing worked strong enough weaponry seriously hurt either horse rider together cavalry could literally trample group incan soldier death many instance macquarries telling incan conquest dozen spanish cavalry charged incan army ten thousand warrior least inflicted dozenstohundreds casualty loss entire battle routed whole incan army standard anticavalry tactic worked every rare swarming sometimes horseman would get tired couldnt gallop away would get overwhelmed suicidally brave incan soldier willing climb top horse despite risk getting stomped stabbed soldier would pull horseman horse onto ground try pry armor andor stab gap armor even rare event occasionally occurred often cavalry would come rescue troubled horseman drive swarm eventually inca crack cavalry certain context incan commander discovered horse dont well slope flat ground cavalry invincible going downhill slow trip fall panic rear otherwise stop invincible killing machine swarmed little effectively also though less flashy cant forget cavalry provided tremendous logistical benefit spaniard incan relay network amazing relative size scale empire incan emperor still couldnt transmit order receive message underling faster speed jogging man meanwhile spanish could move significantly faster shorter longer distance horseback could transmit order faster mount better raiding scouting party retreat easily needed chase fleeing soldier greater ease perform rapid military maneuver native army could never dream think next important spaniard military tech iron applied armor weapon mentioned conquistador cortes pizarro unified professional military unit matching armor set ragtag group adventurer wealthier soldier particularly cavalry would decked plate armor dissimilar medieval night poorer soldier would settle mostly chain mail thick cotton maybe plate piece iron armor whether plate mail almost always tough native weapon aztec obsidian weapon sharp brittle often broke impact armor incan coppertipped spear probably little penetration still outmatched even motley assortment spanish armor apparently sufficient provide extreme protection nearly spaniard combat overwhelming number like every spaniard constantly riposting native attack sword duel rather spaniard constantly taking melee ranged hit sustaining without serious injury bernal dias conquest new spain great book way extremely repetitious cant count many time dia say something like horde native fired bajillion projectile u every single one u man received wound one died mcquarries last day inca constant reference projectile barrage wounded annoyed virtually never killed one point macquarrie note way standard incan projectile kill spaniard happen hit bottom soldier face helmet ended indeed one account spaniard jaw fucked slingthrown rock hit even kill one pizarro brother contrast aztec incan armor never got equivalent level leather usually didnt cover entire body iron sword lance spear ax halberd etc could easily penetrate anything native put stop good example small technological change act huge force multiplier spanish tended use melee weapon stab native warrior tended use melee weapon slash combat time stabbing usually far advantageous compared slashing former allowed attacker keep distance therefore stay danger especially slashing attack reason spanish could use stabbing weapon weapon made iron far harder obsidian wood rock bronze used native stabbing weapon made material broke easily lesser exception bronze whereas iron strong enough stabbing weapon last one little harder parse obviously use gunpowder represents tremendous advantage preiron native military force cortes pizarro many gun possession usually handful cannon cortes ish infantry gun pizarro dozenish handheld gun harquebus extremely primitive compared modern gun firing maybe shot per minute inaccurately europe greatest use penetrating anyandall armor path thats super useful attribute fighting barelyarmored native hand there section conquest new spain dia marvel single harquebus shot regularly killing entire row native warrior say native would clump closely together bearing tiny spanish army wore little armor harquebus shot would go first native warrior keep going bunch penetration still us there psychological factor emperor atahualpas elite bodyguard freaked ran cost life horse reared hind leg snorted imagine native warrior reacted boom gun early th century vast majority fighter surely never heard anything loud entire life certainly nothing produced men inca aztec understandably initially thought spanish using sort magic produced noise killed enemy wasnt captured gun figured advanced technology surprisingly neither macquarrie dia say much spanish artillery except much painintheass lug mexican jungle andean peak granted spanish relatively cannon though advanced handheld gun still fairly primitive europe time napoleonic artillery maneuver still bernal dia mention single cannon shot killing enemy warrior certainly us tactic even people passing knowledge conquistador aware key military tech difference horse iron gunpowder less known reading far less acknowledged scholarly source spanish tactical superiority spanish army far better led native army term momenttomoment leader decisionmaking doctrinal tactical option one military tactic evolved time technology especially soldier become specialized didnt read ton american native warfare mostly seemed like throwing horde soldier opponent vast majority aztec mesoamerican army consisted conscript little training didnt seem much specialization beyond ranged melee unit incan army similar except conquered ethnic group tended fight cohesive unit little variety cant imagine tactical value differentiation compared spaniard early form combined arm warfare utilized heavy infantry cavalry harquebus crossbow cannon example even though cavalry charge ultimate spanish weapon infantry also performed extraordinarily well native army long could hold formation la noche triste biggest spanish disaster cortes conquest also military miracle cortes able extract half army mexican capital despite surrounded enemy army least x larger likewise hernando pizarro managed hold narrow street siege cusco practically forever case heavy spanish infantry tight defensive formation backbone spanish military effort matter much iron armor spaniard soldier isolated would eventually killed native fighter locked protective formation spanish infantry could hold ground use piercing weapon pick away enemy number good example spaniard tactic evolved beyond native tactic positioning leader european army gradually away idea putting leader frontline swedish king gustavus adolphus last major commander famously lead front died battle aztec inca strong tradition putting general frontlines surrounded colorful uniform banner highlight presence supposed good troop morale demonstrate bravery commander guess worked better relatively less deadly clash native army disaster spaniard instance la noche triste cortes lost half army tenochtitlan fled mexican capital desperate retreat aztec army caught forced confrontation battle otumba cortes led exhausted wounded spaniard cavalry equally exhausted wounded native allied warrior comparatively fresh aztec warrior open plain end spanish cortes spotted enemy general frontline decked feather fancy attire ordered cavalry charge general immediately killed virtually entire aztec army routed extremely similar battle occurred later spaniard incan force lima turned tide entire war note spaniard commander also extraordinarily brave often fought near front particularly cortes fought billion small battle spaniard commander rarely tip spear certainly didnt call attention speculate bit spanish military command structure sophisticated therefore loss commander battle would probably less catastrophic impact spanish military organization morale also worth noting spanish army highly tactically superior native army despite spaniard relatively low professional quality spanish conquistador force haphazard collection adventurer littletono prior military experience served mercenary fought europe blacksmith sailor whatever spent lifesaving weapon armor shot rich glory yet still able achieve tactical dominance armed force mexican incan empire including elite specially trained professional army though rankandfile native warrior conscript say native army tactically clueless inca commander particularly seemed adapt pretty quickly try change tactic fight spaniard successful tactic like using uneven land fight cavalry mounting ambush small spanish military unit commander always circled back conclusion couldnt beat massed spanish army didnt matter number lost battle cajamarca forewarning spanish technology tactic lost badly arguably worse siege cusco practically infinite reinforcement tiny trapped spanish army whenever spanish sufficient number probably least soldier competent leadership native defeat inevitable completing conquest battle cajamarca went better pizarro could dreamed men defeated army maybe according spaniard battle entire countryside covered dead incan body better yet emperor atahualpa spanish custody time inca turn page next part cortes playbook using captured native emperor extort entire country like cortes spanish initially treated captured native emperor well pizarro top lieutenant calm sit

atahualpa hostage could killed moment worth offering spanish basically amount gold silver get free stupid barbarian would hopefully fuck back wherever came emperor atahualpa made pitch pizarro would give room full gold twentytwo foot long seventeen foot wide filled white line halfway height would set eight foot tall also would throw whole lot silver spanish would let go pizarro clearly amazed atahualpas offer amazed didnt know legitimate didnt seem conceivable even aztec could cough much treasure pizarro thought maybe emperor buying time came plot escape seeing better immediate plan

seemingly nowhere gathering valley numerous looked like mass toy soldier poured upon ground spanish cavalry scouted army actually charged innumerable mass killed hundred routed significant portion nearly captured manco inca stole bunch royal treasury emperor gotten away inca rallied began surround spanish cavalry pulled back city incan army made camp hill mountain completely surrounding cusco opposed total spanish soldier horse includes returning scout along native ally soldier led three younger pizarro hernando overall command juan gonzalo serving top lieutenant along ponce de leon would later discover florida fail find fountain youth notably among native ally pasac cousin manco inca stayed loyal spanish though spanish cavalry soldier toptier foot soldier relatively recent arrival hadnt fought cajamarca first battle cusco rather latecoming opportunist hoping piece pie firsthand account described thin scrawny men siege cusco began may spanish believed well truly fucked discounting native ally probably outnumbered least completely cut reinforcement wasnt like cusco impregnable fortress werent even wall around city spanish ally retreated city center set tight base operation relatively street cover chance flanked inca spent first day getting organized tried set camp supply line largest army assembled human history south america point possibly day kept war cry day night freak spanish worked manco inca presided big ceremony including macquarrie call sacrifice assume human variety hernando pizarro tried deploying cavalry unit venture city look weakness every time killed ton inca retreat swarm attacker absolute tsunami projectile suffered one fatal casualty one rare successful swarm event occurred mounted soldier pulled horse rest spanish cavalry retreated saw inca decapitate soldier horse day incan army assaulted cusco spanish squeezed side even smaller space city center tempo battle set would remain place month inca would shower spanish soldier endless barrage projectile annoying often wounded rarely killed meanwhile incan infantry unit would move toward city center usually met resistance form heavy spanish infantry locked defensive formation could hold native attacker infantry group exhausted incan warrior found unguarded street spanish cavalry came trump card annihilate everything path exhausted pull back finally native ally took support role medic supply transporter occasionally combatant gap appeared fighting like continued month early day inca employed additional sensible tactic spanish squeezed center used projectile set fire much city center possible probably figuring easier rebuild cusco kill armored spaniard came closest working completely defeating spanish first day fighting spaniard pushed two large building started burn saved black slave stationed roof put fire hernandoled counterattack left least indian dead ground early day fighting lot going incan army favor many spaniard assumed would die spanish also positive factor highlight one somehow miraculously single spanish soldier died far besides one horseman decapitated along native ally meanwhile hundred thousand inca died kd ratio chart second hernando pizarro despite universally acknowledged asshole nearly despised men much inca proving exceptional commander calm pressure incredibly brave excellent personal fighter helped physical beast well six foot height sound tactician finally bewildering inca wouldnt fight night overwhelming manpower advantage inca could easily kept assault spanish dropped dead exhaustion instead retired back camp sundown every day thereby allowing spanish rest strategize next day attack following week month continued pattern inca credit fair amount tactical experimentation tried building anticavalry barricade street apparently horse slammed jumped result anticavalry pit found better luck pushing wall stone onto cavalry unit another cavalry unit came rescue saved beleaguered horseman another brief success use bola trip horse cavalry unit started bringing infantry particularly native ally free horse hit incan general kept coming conclusion nothing could cavalry flat ground wasnt easy spanish stay locked combat endless wave projectile fire periodically setup demolish street barricade keep enemy bay mount exhausting charge enemy formation worked fact worked well incan body blood covering street cusco caused problem spanish knew could hold incan attack also knew chance ultimate survival either holding reinforcement arrived punching hole besieging army fleeing cusco end hernando pizarro conceived daring maneuver wanted use chunk force sally forth seize nearby fort saqsaywaman held inca used major base operation siege hernando figured taking fort would weaken incan encirclement give spanish secondary base safety problem taking would extremely difficult would also leave spaniard central cusco shorthanded fending attack nevertheless hernando pizarro deployed cavalry support soldier led juan pizarro task early day fortress assault juan ran aid fallen cavalry comrade sustained slinged rock right unarmored jaw projectile said break sword half juans face fucked couldnt wear helmet anymore regardless juan pizarro led men attack saqsaywaman macquarrie describes three row wall foot long foot high made massive stone weighing ton guarded total incan warrior led villac umu equivalent incan pope insane dont know thing real people real life first juan men rode cusco force blasted throughoutran incan force sent stop approached grassy plain laid fortress directly assaulted fortress time fewer men opposing army made frontal assault guess intention climbing wall found ginormous hail projectile extreme even armor impossible advance retreated regrouped launched another attack time trying slam way wicker barricade covering main gate somehow worked despite projectile fire spanish began penetrate fortress first time since conquest started five year ago spanish military force lost engagement least temporarily support soldier already fallen first assault time juan pizarro hit another slinged rock crushing skull spanish soldier breached fortress pushed back counterattack retreated make camp beyond range projectile still near fortress juan picked comrade carried battlefield died two week later head wound left ducat pound gold million modern usd already fabulously wealthy brother gonzalo instead native wife halfnative daughter hernando cortes faced tough day fighting back cusco cavalry gone yet night deployed brother gonzalo one stole manco inca wife take command attack saqsaywaman along cavalry time villac umu received incan soldier reinforcement fortress gonzalo stroke genius least stroke insight terrible strategy gathered already exhausted assault force readied attack time night somehow ish spaniard built bunch ladder rushed wall early hour morning climbed wall got inside took entire fortress guarded something like native warrior commanding inside villac umu retreated deeper deeper fortress couldnt stop spanish matter many men threw especially narrow corridor eventually fled saqsaywaman soldier many incan warrior jumped fortress wall death rather die battle get captured macquarrie put total incan death toll fight saqsaywaman soldier maybe another fighting cusco spanish dead siege cusco first day maybe five spaniard two african slave handful native ally though spaniard cusco completely cut outside world word eventually spread throughout peru francisco pizarro heard going immediately gathered relief force break siege soldier distributed among city including lima within week gathered two small army sent toward cusco additionally pizarro grabbed nearest member royal family cousin manco inca named cusirimac declared new emperor incan empire hasty ceremony spot wish macquarrie gave character detail though doubt relevant historical record exist sense get francisco soberminded brother though got insanely rich peru even picked local mistress year old sister manco inca allegedly treated well didnt seem engage psychopathic westworldstyle torturing native even height wealth power peru dressed simply rather decking silk spent free time walking around farm playing commonman sport seemed concerned attaining glory wielding thus wonder francisco super pissed brother fucked everything im also little surprised francisco didnt lead relief force guess getting wasnt eager anymore literally lead men battle regardless skillfully organized response rebellion put plan motion save brother life although one already dead unfortunately francisco emperor manco inca dispatched incan army stop spanish relief force command general quizo yupanqui one last surviving general served huayna capac general quizo would soon prove napoleon incan military command though maybe erwin rommel better comparison order use superior manpower local knowledge tie spanish relief force road manco inca main army crushed spaniard cusco instead general quizo decided going destroy relief army entirely sometimes think historian bend backwards defend strategic decision native army fought conquistador opinion unavoidable conclusion cortes pizarro outclassed aztec incan commander spanish military doctrine far ahead incan military doctrine hence native pretty idiotic stuff like aztec repeatedly trying capture spanish soldier sacrifice instead killing inca refusing fight night seemingly posting night sentry middle battle native commander idiot wellaware severely outmatched militarily technologically tried different strategy tactic reverse disadvantage usually failed sometimes succeeded better example general quizo figure stop three spanish army consisting mostly cavalry knew men probably couldnt beat straight fight decided drop giant rock granted plan sound like something year old would come complicated soon spanish relief force started marching network incan spy runner brought report general quizo maneuvered army toward closest one consisting soldier marched quickly narrow mountain road foot general knew would tire fast dont forget effect high altitude picked particular spot road went canyon launched ambush projectile surprised spaniard ran back way came regroup soon reached river crossed bridge except bridge gone inca destroyed atop surrounding canyon wall bunch inca pushed gigantic boulder splattered numerous spaniard horse feeling trapped spaniard fled direction ran hoard incan warrior coming road overwhelmed ran river drowned spanish soldier killed captured far greatest victory incan empire since spaniard arrived shore general quizo sent captured spanish soldier along spanish sword harquebus cannon small warrior detachment back cusco present emperor manco inca general quizo set next relief force numbering spanish soldier time general quite literally crushed avalanche boulder yet another spanish army wiped map back cusco many soldier couldnt beat spaniard general quizos army unfortunately manpower number given took spanish soldier matter day spanish army currently en route general quizo took force detour encomiendaowning spaniard nearby town apparently hoping whole rebellion thing would blow according macquarrie hoping men would enough deter incan army attacking didnt expect general quizo impossible something military night mean incan army didnt attack night surrounded town attacked dawn pretty good incan army spaniard held awhile similar fighting style cusco within day overwhelmed killed captured man thus bringing general quizos inflicted casualty count spanish soldier back lima francisco pizarro idea going spaniard native information spy network nowhere near sophisticated inca rebellion assuming two deployed relief force fine pizarro deployed two spanish army one consisted soldier cavalry tasked escorting new alleged emperor cusirimac cusco assume throne siege broken general quizo set another ambush small force though time without giant boulder whether fortune coordination incan army attacked emperor cusirimac entourage turned spanish butchered behind spanish cavalry cut two escaped general quizos killcapture count rose spanish soldier left single spanish relief force consisting cavalry macquarrie doesnt even bother giving much detail part sent pizarro gone four soldier made ambush retreated back cusco general quizos casualty count rose around onethird spanish soldier peru spanish soldier including cavalry remained lima francisco pizarro command needed every man horse general quizo began march lima warrior order take city back cusco massive incan army continued daily assault spaniard native ally hernando pizarro lieutenant held daily strategy discussion debated holding relief force francisco pizarro trying break city idea franciscos relief army already destroyed manco inca told seemed like good idea ended backfiring emperor order soldier threw head five captured spaniard city center besieged soldier see inca also threw one thousand rippedup letter collected relief force apparently manco inca thought would demoralize soldier see talking paper shred macquarrie note even three year among spaniard seems manco idea writing worked spaniard arrival letter opposite impact intended soldier pieced many page could together got bunch letter loved one back spain well news great victory moor spanish king celebrated vowed fight inca even harder hernando pizarro even rallied cavalry launched insane breakout cusco flee city drive straight heart incan army try capture emperor manco inca whole crazy subplot end manco inca fleeing captured horse inca flooding plain destroying dam stop hernandos advance spanish ended killing ton native losing bunch horse sustaining death among spanish soldier retreating back cusco back lima spanish cavalry spanish infantry several thousand native warrior prepared defend city incan warrior led easily best general quizo yupanqui macquarrie describes atmosphere city apocalyptic news filtered back cusco desperate siege relief force wiped many encomienda holder dead entire spanish conquest incan empire felt like coming cataclysmic end hand year old emperor general quizos army surrounded lima way manco inca army surrounded cusco general even used clay model map battle plan noting besieging lima would difficult cusco former coast land flatter spanish cavalry effective general quizos order take city capture francisco pizarro alive kill capture rest spaniard summarily execute native collaborator problem general judgment wise strategy another siege like cusco could cut spaniard starve indefinitely thereby bypassing fighting would doubtlessly cost many native life every one spaniard life however emperor manco inca order capture lima quick victory would nail coffin spanish morale general quizo could march back cusco bunch captured spanish soldier weapon help finish siege general quizo left classic general dilemma dictate sound military strategy diametrically opposed dictate sound political strategy command bos judgment general quizo mounted direct assault lima approach firsthand account related francisco pizarro seeing multitude warrior doubt whatsoever side completely lost yet disaster inca land flat incan army approached mass ten thousand spanish combination harquebus canon cavalry simply annihilated native troop native ally rushed mop general quizo pulled men back reset siege four day passed general decided try assaulting lima night gathered lieutenant gave speech pledging victory death tomorrow battle bonus told top lieutenant least dozen spanish woman city could divide woman among eugenically breed great warrior clearly spaniard phenomenal fighter next day great general quizo led incan military effort defeating rd spanish force figured beat spanish cavalry sort learned night fighting brought incan people close final victory spanish menace utterly botched garish clothes surrounded fancy courtier general quizo rode front army elaborate litter carried servant leading spanish army rear francisco pizarro decided charge cavalry incan guy looked like charge went one would expect general quizo along lieutenant killed cavalry charge outset battle rest incan army turned fled spanish chased stabbing hacking exhausted stab hack anymore lima saved third incan rebellion along best general destroyed siege cusco lasted another four month manco inca mass warrior successfully cut hernando pizarro spaniard hundred native ally outside world apparently enough supply hold awhile incan force could never break assault dont know francisco pizarro never mounted another relief force help brother maybe concerned splitting meager remaining force losing another relief column road cusco instead spaniard cusco saved direction diego de almagros expedition chile gone well spent almost two year southern venture basically nothing show francisco pizarro waltzed peru captured emperor one two largest empire western hemisphere ransomed unfathomable fortune sacked capital almost resistance set governorship something like million native seemed easy almagro tried thing chile found native far poorer far decentralized far willing fight death community total almagro lost spaniard half horse native ally warrior basically generated loot worth mentioning chile wasnt worth conquering almagro still spanish soldier mounted thousand native ally news incan rebellion finally reached marched north remained army advance sent messenger francisco pizarro spaniard trapped cusco emperor manco inca friend back early day spanish occupation almagro told manco inca spanish soldier lie expecting seabound reinforcement soldier also lie coming cusco true negotiate end rebellion maybe true another instance wish characterization available point northward march almagro seemingly decided maneuver save spanish comrade rather golden opportunity exploit fluid legal system conquistador claim new world almagro realized could use incan rebellion steal peru pizarro least steal cusco southern peru possibly help old friend manco inca sort negotiated settlement incan rebellion somehow within cusco hernando pizarro found almagros diplomatic overture toward manco inca immediately figured almagro doublecrossing made similar diplomatic overture incan emperor offered forgive manco inca men treason would lift siege also told almagro liar scoundrel shouldnt trust anything said sudden political situation incan empire lot complex wasnt enormous incan rebellion trying failing destroy beleaguered undestroyable spanish force threeway conflict pizarro holding major city infrastructure almagro strongest concentrated force manco inca holding countryside commanding endless mass native warrior arguably improvement situation emperor manco inca unfortunately macquarrie light detail period siege four month defeat general quizo lima presumably expectation spanish would eventually get reinforcement abroad francisco pizarro sent desperate request help spanish colony spain start rebellion break siege manco inca force could crush hernando pizarro force thus entry almagro onto scene offered manco inca hope playing two spanish faction ending decent position one side defeated albeit probably sort powersharing arrangement pizarro almagro rather returning full mastery peru incan dynasty emperor manco inca figure spanish force side pizarro almagro obviously latter natural choice based current military situation past friendship also almagro never taken emperor wifesister sex slave almagro also spaniard manco inca point figured trust spaniard emperor manco inca met almagros emissary consisted two spaniard native ally emperor asked spaniard prove loyalty trustworthiness chopping one hand native ally spaniard understandably hesitated unchristian nature request new world new world one grabbed sword tried cut four native finger rather whole hand good enough manco inca alliance agreed upon incan rebellion almagro pizarro spanish guy rui diaz screwed another almagro emissary arrived shortly two emissary mangled native companion left personal friend manco inca apparently believed could negotiate threeway truce end war manco inca asked diaz sum money could pay spanish king call spaniard peru rather string along diaz answered honestly even mountain made gold silver give king would still withdraw spaniard land guess left manco inca bad mood decided hit diaz another loyalty test time ordered diaz kill spanish prisoner captured one pizarro relief force dia refused manco inca ordered arrested decided couldnt trust almagro alliance within day beginning almagro way cusco army manco inca force couldnt beat exhausted spaniard trapped cusco definitely couldnt beat however many men almagro bringing manco inca retreated army defensible position countryside waited see would happen almagro pizarro nine month siege cusco ended spanish sustained singledigit death along loss dozen hundred native ally incan army easily lost thousand take long intraspanish feud get going earnest almagro arrived cusco soldier put little pretense acting liberating force snuck men city middle night time hernando pizarro figured going almagros men seized key point cusco pizarro launched attack street easily overwhelmed ended besieged single building group loyalist including gonzalo pizarro lot men captured surrendered even joined almagro even bravely successfully leading incredible military victory still hated hernando pizarro likewise almagro personally hated hernando even good term francisco pizarro brief standoff looked like almagro going burn hernando men alive building rather die surrender hernando led heroic charge intending fight death however gonzalo rest loyalist beaten battle captured news quickly spread coup francisco pizarro formed man army mostly consisting reinforcement sea sent cusco retake incan capital ish year old francisco pizarro delegated leadership lieutenant defection almagro amassed spanish soldier native ally warrior arent many detail manco inca army point fighting loss normal attrition massive army likely decline rather stand wait two spanish army destroy maybe leave opening good inca attack emperor switched tactic announced dissolution rebellion army conversion guerrilla warfare concluded spanish simply could beaten open battle hope resistance using great mass population mastery landscape pick away spanish force probably right call also signaled true end real hope incan aristocracy taking back sovereignty empire back cusco military command almagros force fell almagro also secondincommand year old rodrigo orgonez like rest guy crazy checkered past son jew converted spanish inquisition fled hometown warrant arrest due brawl fought italian war personally helped capture french king completely stole last name local aristocrat make sound noble course went new world shot unfathomable fame fortune like pizarro almagro ultimate goal become governor province live like king failed get slice chile wanted slice peru almagros secondincommand also hell commander went meet man relief army led pizarro lieutenant spanish soldier thousand native ally launched fantastic night attack killed handful pizarro men routed captured rest within day pizarro relief force switched side joined orgonez almagro enormous victory almagro consolidated hold southern peru sent orgonez spaniard track capture emperor manco inca nearly succeeded emperor close caught left behind bunch wife mummified body huayna capac manco inca choice retreat even inland beyond andes amazon jungle set new capital city almagro crowned paullu yet another son huayna capac brave commander fought alongside almagro year new inca emperor complete elaborate ceremony cusco loss yet another relief force francisco pizarro hit another serious setback still probably better position almagro overall almagro larger army controlled capital pizarro state apparatus port needed time bring reinforcement take another shot cusco end pizarro sent lawyer friend enter negotiation almagro really job drag discussion long possible buy time im sure almagros position weak negotiating stopped attacking lima either way orgonez sat around cusco month chasing away manco inca time gonzalo pizarro somehow escaped pizarro lawyer convinced almagro release hernando pizarro event left orgonez fuming advising almagro execute two pizarro brother since capture cusco fair almagro worried alienating spanish king went hard pizarro also old age lawyer moralistic argument good christian seemed gotten five month fake negotiating francisco pizarro amassed new army spanish soldier mostly fresh boat placed hernando pizarro head marched cusco met outside city almagros army spanish soldier led orgonez native ally led emperor paullu macquarries description battle la salina little confusing telling normally skilled orgonez believed hernando pizarro wouldnt launch direct attack reason pizarro fact pizarro army seemingly walked right orgonezs army fired harquebus bunch crossbow destroying significant portion orgonezs army single volley orgonez ordered desperate charge back foot army swiftly crushed orgonez dying battle emperor paullu suddenly switching side collapse flank macquarrie put orgonez side death toll pizarro army losing nine almagro watched battle nearby hill fled back city end pizarro army easily took cusco small garrison left behind captured almagro quite old unwell asked speak francisco pizarro still back lima hernando pizarro ever asshole refused ordered almagro executed garrote without trial completing conquest get rds last day inca im far im concerned end expedition conquistador spanish expedition conquer incan empire began earnest ended pizarro spanish competitor dead captured coopted puppetemperor form paullu still incan resistance pushed edge empire longer realistic hope overthrowing spanish peru conquered rush interesting bit rest story epilogue manco inca launched guerrilla war pizarrodominated peru seven year spanish initially suffered decent casualty inca went back targeting encomiendaholders emerging trade route eventually spanish security measure counterinsurgency operation ie burning entire village put stop spanish made attempt crush manco inca new capital vilcabamba amazon jungle always surprising spanish failure due logistics far away major city send large army small cavalry force didnt well jungle especially bowwielding local native ally inca however gonzalo pizarro eventually mounted man expedition despite losing cavalry early another boulder ambush encountering gun horsewielding inca eventually broke vilcabamba sacked city gonzalo rounded executed nearly remaining inca general rebellious nobility manco inca escaped went hiding peruvian countryside nine year arrived peru start conquest three year defeat almagro francisco pizarro sitting one lima villa lunch group friend associate men stormed house shouted intent murder bunch disgruntled exalmagro supporter blamed pizarro destroying shot fortune incorporating state new castille almagros defeat lunch guest ran year old pizarro leastuseful halfbrother franciscomartin pizarro two guest stayed fought still strategist pizarro maneuvered doorway create bottleneck held mass attacker single combat one attacker grabbed another attacker threw pizarro like human shield pizarro stabbed guy attacker used opportunity get past blade stab defender death francisco pizarro assassinated like julius caesar pizarro warned advance plot spy among conspirator pizarro dismissed story indian gossip governorship succeeded viceroy sent peru spanish crown soon assassination supporter almagro called almagristas actually formed small army insurrection defeated seven survivor ran away somehow found emperor manco inca roving around wilderness continuing lowlevel guerilla war manco inca took seven spaniard used advisor train soldier spanish combat technique well teach personally spanish culture leadership religion etc full two year living inca daily conversation manco inca seven spaniard hatched crazy scheme playing sport emperor one spaniard suddenly pulled knife repeatedly stabbed back spaniard fled stolen horse intending go cusco would tell regime new castille feat hope getting pardon instead inca tracked night murdered manco inca succumbed wound died age year gonzalo pizarro good though extremely rich famous respected new world also pissed king sent bureaucrat spain take new castille viceroy franciscos assassination worse yet viceroy implemented new law ended native slavery regulated brutality encomiendas gonzalo bunch equally disgruntled conquistador wanted exploit native peace revolted spanish viceroy quickly took peru men crowned new viceroy assumed dictatorial power im sure gonzalos ultimate plan even plan dont expert th century spanish politics know revolt wasnt going last first spanish king sent emissary new castile announce part new law would scaled back offered pardon many insurrectionist fractured gonzalos rank went pretty severe reign terror ultimately executing spaniard questionable loyalty two year gonzalo seized power viceroy collected army coast delivered spain colony attacked gonzalos force defeated battle jaquijahuana mostly due bunch defection rank spanish viceroy killed fighting gonzalo fought practically last man surrendered next day executed decapitation age following year incan emperor paullu died never played big role conquest interesting ultimately incan game throne son huayna capac supporter manco inca ordered paullu accompany diego de almagro chilean expedition year earned almagros trust military commander native ally force helped almagro seize cusco hernando pizarro almagro crowned emperor despite manco inca still alive battle la salina emperor paullu betrayed almagro helped hernando pizarro force win subsequently retake cusco treachery emperor paullu kept throne proceeded rule year died peacefully sometimes collaborating work point one pizarro left second oldest hernando pizarro actually picture awhile fought battle cajamarca commanded spanish force defense cusco manco inca captured almagro released led brother army defeat almagro orgonez la salina executed almagro without brother permission next went back spain shore francisco pizarro legal claim new world deceased almagro preemptively defend charge criminality conduct defense realm turn bit preemptive lieutenant almagro got spain hernando convinced king hernando unjustly murdered almagro rightful governor southern peru hernando arrived soon afterward presented case king almagro traitor guess hernando better fighter talker failed persuade hernando pizarro arrested thrown prison year got age outlived brother prematurely aged harsh condition least still conquistador money hernando pizarro lived another year dying last pizarro brother conquistador spanish conquest historical case study civilizational contrast importance individual decisionmaking beyond recounting adventure cortes pizarro want try conceptually explain conquistador fascinating evaluating historical figure lot like evaluating survivor contestant toughest part discerning merit circumstance luck franklin delano roosevelt one impactful president history personally made lot excellent decision brought america great depression world war ii right place right time basically competent american politician put context would ended legacy fdr president benjamin harrison quantumly swapped would consider harrison one greatest president time roosevelt historical footnote acknowledging requires tremendous amount subjective judgment recognition ambiguity think place start parsing merit circumstance analyzing quality quantity historical figure individual decisionmaking instance know napoleon great military commander one commanded something like battle lost maybe prime facie hard win many battle sheer luck high enough number expect randomness mostly shaken thats even factoring napoleon military decisionmaking outside battle strategic maneuvering entire army logistical management etc assume napoleon individual military command decision significant impact win record thats matter quantity regarding seemingly good decisionmaking quality napoleon battle side always overwhelming number french troop superior command staff excellent factor gave advantageous circumstance maybe mediocre french general age could put charge battle similar outcome know isnt true mix match variable historical figure context many general napoleon age none except possibly arthur wellesley achieved anything remotely close napoleon quantity quality win napoleon many competent marshal command staff tried command independently worse napoleon despite overseeing similar army badly even competence member command staff called question napoleon battle overwhelming military superiority also many incredible victory inferior force ex austerlitz borodino even take broader view compare extent napoleon decisionmaking commander across military era speaking roughly general napoleonic era unusually important battle outcome compared era back medieval europe army disorganized general issue many minute command world war ii army vast military decisionmaking increasingly delegated army technologically disparate tech often dictated correct strategy tactic hence many famously overrated general like patton macarthur era napoleonic era sweet spot army complex maneuverable vast technological hence general decisionmaking elevated key factor battle outcome hence napoleon achievement even impressive look napoleon military career come conclusion record victory attributable skill one explanation alleged accomplishment luck napoleon individual decisionmaking didnt win battle must gotten extremely lucky hed one luckiest people history especially factor achievement across political diplomatic civic domain even without detailed understanding napoleonic history easy dismiss argument level luck needed give napoleon military career extraordinarily unlikely framework mind consider impressive spanish conquest new world civilizational perspective imagine year chinese warrior showed english shore tried take kingdom edward even chinese technological superiority time dont think plausible million english people would end ruled chinese monarch bit fairer maybe shift time frame right middle first baron war major civil war throw fictitious chinese plague kill english population even cant imagine wellled chinese soldier would expertly navigate political climate end ruling england london next year thats pretty much happened new world twice yes cortes pizarro arrived respective empire time relative weakness though think often overstated historian yes assisted local ally ultimately men ended ruling empire million people minuscule military force cunning diplomacy leveraged technological advancement think better historical example contrast civilizational power whatever want call spanish conquest new world remarkably doesnt discount competence cortes pizarro technological disparity spanish new world native vast number opposite direction couldnt put random spanish commander charge conquistador army find level success one relevant data point many failed conquest venture spanish conquistador one pizarro lieutenant ponce de leon died wound received second venture florida another lieutenant hernando de soto launched expedition tore across southeastern u died fever near mississippi river little ultimately came expedition vasquez de coronado found similar success southwestern u went bankrupt charged war crime died infectious disease retreating lucas de aylln established first spanish settlement would become united state colonist died starvation disease san miguel de gualdape abandoned conquest incan empire alone almagro orgonez gonzalo pizarro juan pizarro many top spanish lieutenant could considered failed conquistador since ultimately killed venture even relevant data point found detail conquest new spain last day inca cortes pizarro made dozen hundred thousand decision impacted fortune could led death francisco pizarro first encountered man army led emperor atahualpa cajamarca could gone wrong million different way pizarro could tried deal emperor diplomatically gotten ambushed enslaved castrated pizarro could messed ambush lost battle cajamarca pizarro men could fled middle night retreated back coast unified emboldened incan army could hunted battle cajamarca battle pizarro cortes fought one bajillion arrow dart javelin slinged rock could hit face killed right thenandthere delegation obviously important amazing many key decision directly made cortes pizarro evaluate president fdr consider many administration policy determined enacted cabinet member assistant secretary etc cortes pizarro ground thick thing surrounded mere hundred questionably loyal men often one making decision resulted success failure life death ultimately succeeded beyond wildest expectation billion thing could gone wrong billion different outcome would worse pizarro cortes complete victory achieved complete victory imagine quantum computer could run cortes pizarro conquest simulator slightly different variable time attempt many time would succeed obviously im pulling completely as id give win swapped conquest id give cortes win incan empire pizarro fewer win mexican empire id give significantly win average commander day maybe said cant help take another swipe revisionist claim narrative highly upvoted often linked series reddit post op attempt undermine success cortes argument concerning military capability diplomacy importance native ally etc occasionally interesting point made reading kept finding general argument absurd foot view cortes really bumbling incompetent commander constantly manipulated crafty native ally end ruling mexican empire odds insanely incredibly phenomenally lucky dozen battle diplomatic negotiation odds francisco pizarro equally lucky year later find spanish new world conquest fascinating incredible case study historical analysis simultaneously clear instance sharp civilizational contrast value individual decisionmaking achieving unlikely historical outcome share related thought conquest inca excellent work one small thing want highlight another advantage spanish stabbing weapon native slashing weapon would fact pack troop together frontlines theyre packed shoulder shoulder like phalanx formation rather needing space swinging weapon give lot benefit think go way explaining spanish kept winning fight despite outnumbered like melee combat allow larger force use full number battle theyll stuck back unable fight contrast ranged combat backline troop still shoot kind melee combat spanish capable inherently give advantage frontline inca might outnumbered spanish actual point contact might incan warrior club v spaniard spear zooming frontline formation level might incan warrior club loosely spaced line versus spanish spearmen dense formation multiple rank deep point doesnt matter incan warrior like incan warrior behind ready waiting step onto frontline slot open extra troop arent fight incan warrior brutally outnumbered actual fighting incan advantage number essentially advantage wood waiting fed woodchipper rather tidal wave crashing spanish thats something see lot military history generally speaking locally outnumbering enemy point contact despite globally outnumbering something every tactician strives every great general history achieved key almost every stunning upset victory outnumber enemy lanchesters square law httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwpjxwbwlkie give advantage almost automatically troop mean firepower eliminating enemy hit hitpoints absorbing enemy firepower without taking loss specific case lanchesters square law might go far enough honestly v spanish versus incan engagement might actually like v parrying thing opposing attack cancel situation incan warrior attack one spanish spearmen parry blow leaving free stab incan warrior spanish spearmen attack angle incan warrior parry attack direction stab combination superior reach spanish spear giving free turn stab incan warrior move club range spanish dont advantage much infinity advantage incan warrior doesnt get attack dying swing probably doesnt hit chance parry hit probably doesnt even anything bounce spanish armor man must tough incan warrior question say think understand soldier beat look less like battle like wood lining fed woodchipper gifs crowd charging phalanx rome total war httpswwwredditcomrgamingcommentsektototalwarromechargingapikephalanxheadon also probably explains like spanish cavalryman could keep charging strong incan army capturealmost capture incan emperor matter density incan formation dense blobbed together one spot like pike phalanx could absorbed blow think went every instinct honed year clubbased combat bet alternative universe aztec inca focused wooden spear instead club spanish expedition doomed got overwhelmed sheer number course well never know likeliked person great stuff filled blank thanks likelike say reading whole story give opposite conclusion kind demystifying francisco pizarro seems good warlord really worldclass certainly proportionate impact history quizo yupanqui manco inca sound like anything better leader spanish leader nothing special pizarro succeeded due level technological advantage outnumbered cakewalk soldier even hopeless blatantly copying cortez conquest political strategy yes people would failed even advantage quite might done even better likeliked person blog get better better ive also got nerdy fascination medieval primitive arm armour thought lot conquistador v aztecinca coming leaning towards interpretation reddit thread tech advantage couldnt enough overcome numerical odds even cant penetrate steel armour primitive weapon still deadly bare flesh th century harness lot gap unarmoured spot like face leg sometimes arm conquistador get hit enough attack something eventually get also read account pizarro exploring coast discovered inca quite multiple time would say stuff like random conquistador got hit ten time leg arrow evacuated fighting handful tribesman summary make sound like impervious arrowssling stone etc im wondering armour wearing wasnt standard th century configuration something specialised going barrage stone wood weapon id want full body coverage including face id probably use lot chainmail since much effective steel stabbing weapon flexible enough dont need leave gap mobility like plate maybe looked like high medieval knight normal th century soldier theyre usually depicted likeliked person couldnt throw net cavalry quipu practice make would think suited retiarius technique maybe combined boulder entrap city center starve long could really held likeliked person one would think im especially curious much supply spaniard cusco guess werent many people thousand including civilian considering quickly manco inca force arrived city im surprised enough month siege likelike great post planning cover afonso de albuquerque next opinion he also
