How to Help Victims of the Myanmar Earthquake,"As relief efforts continue in Southeast Asia after a devastating earthquake hit Myanmar, here's how you can help those impacted.","How to Help Victims of the Myanmar Earthquake Reporter After a devastating earthquake in central Myanmar, medical workers are seen next to medical materials placed in the compound of a hospital in the country's capital, Naypyidaw, on March 28, 2025. Reporter Relief efforts continue in Southeast Asia after a devastating 7.7 earthquake shook Myanmar and its neighbors on Friday, March 28. Per an update shared by the Myanmar authorities on Saturday, the death toll has risen above 1,600. In addition, authorities report over 3,000 people are injured, with over 100 others missing. Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city, is among the hardest-hit areas, with widespread destruction. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a total of 18 people have been reported killed by the earthquake so far. 11 of those were at the site of the collapse of a high-rise building under construction. Dozens of people are said to be unaccounted for. Advertisement Advertisement On Sunday, March 30, a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck near Mandalay, prompting alarm before rescue efforts continued. Read More: Photos Show Devastating Impact of Powerful Earthquake That Rocked Myanmar and Thailand Myanmar’s ruling military junta declared a state of emergency in several regions affected by the earthquake on Friday, and called for humanitarian aid in a rare show of international appeal. Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said in a statement that the earthquake “could not come at a worse time” for Myanmar, as it still reels from the 2021 military coup and subsequent displacement of masses in a civil war. “All parties to the armed conflict should be prioritizing the needs of civilians whose lives have been upended in this disaster and ensuring that they have unfettered access to aid,” Freeman said. “Human rights must be at the centre of all relief efforts, and there must be no discrimination in aid provision.” UNICEF, originally the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, has also addressed Myanmar’s precarious situation. A statement on the UNICEF USA website has called for “all parties to uphold the rights of children and ensure unhindered humanitarian access.” As the affected areas continue to recover—a process that has only just begun—countries around the globe have come out to send humanitarian aid. Here are the ways that you can help victims of the Myanmar earthquake. U.N. Crisis Relief The United Nations is calling for donations in addition to an initial allocation of $5 million from the U.N. Emergency Fund by Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher. Donations will go directly to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund, and will “provide them with urgently needed food, water, shelter and other basic support at this critical time.” Red Cross The “Red Cross Red Crescent is working to deliver emergency relief and to get help to those impacted by the earthquake as quickly as possible.” Teams from the Myanmar Red Cross Society are also working to connect hospitals and clinics with emergency blood donations. UNICEF USA UNICEF runs disaster relief operations focused on children’s needs and has asked for donations specifically for children impacted and displaced by the earthquake. “UNICEF is on the ground in Myanmar, working with partners to meet children's needs. The earthquake is the latest blow to a country already struggling with escalating conflict and climate shocks,” the agency’s website reads. Save the Children Save the Children is an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) that works specifically to protect children at risk. They have launched a “Children’s Emergency Fund” for youths in Myanmar in need of shelter and other basic needs in the aftermath of the disaster. Project HOPE Project HOPE is working to “address both urgent and long-term needs, including primary and mental health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene,” for those affected by the earthquake. The nonprofit organization has previously responded to other natural disasters by deploying humanitarian aid to places such as Morocco, Syria, Turkey, and Haiti.

"Russia, China sent hundreds of people to help Myanmar, as the US sends three","The United States is sending a three-person disaster response team to earthquake-stricken Myanmar, days after much larger contingents from China and Russia began pulling people out of the rubble.","US sends three-person disaster response team to earthquake-stricken Myanmar after USAID gutted Topic:Disaster and Emergency Response Chinese rescue workers at the site of a collapsed building in Myanmar's second-largest city Mandalay. (Reuters) In short: A three-person team sent by the US is set to arrive in Myanmar following a 7.7-magnitude earthquake. Much larger teams of Chinese and Russian search-and-rescue experts have already been in the country for days. What's next? A former USAID official has criticised the US response, saying it makes the world's richest-country look ""weak and irrelevant"". The United States is sending a three-person disaster response team to earthquake-stricken Myanmar, days after much larger contingents from China and Russia began pulling people out of the rubble. The scaled-down response was evidence of the US's abdication of its role as a world leader, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a former lead for disaster relief at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). ""It's not a case of worst-practice, it's really a case of no-practice,"" Mr Konyndyk, who is now president of Refugees International, told the ABC. ""It just makes the US look, frankly, kind of weak and irrelevant to most of the other countries that have shown up in force to support the people of Myanmar."" Help is urgently needed The ABC is working in partnership with the Emergency Action Alliance to help those affected by the disaster. The New York Times reported the US team was expected to arrive on Wednesday — five days after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake flattened large parts of the country's biggest cities on Friday. The death toll according to Myanmar's ruling junta, known as the State Administrative Council (SAC), stands at more than 2,700. However, the US Geological Survey's predictive modelling has estimated it could eventually surpass 10,000. United Nations officials who surveyed earthquake damage in Myanmar on Tuesday urged the global community to ramp up aid before the looming monsoon season worsens already catastrophic conditions. The UN has highlighted clean drinking water, hygiene, food, shelter and medicine as Myanmar's most urgent needs. (Reuters) Drinking water, hygiene, food, shelter and medicine were the most critical needs following extensive damage to buildings, roads and bridges, said Marcoluigi Corsi, acting humanitarian and resident coordinator. On Sunday, the US embassy in Myanmar announced a contribution of up to $US2 million in aid. US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the assessment team of three people would ""identify the people's most pressing needs, including emergency shelter, food, medical needs and access to water"". Myanmar earthquake death toll approaches 3,000 At least 2,700 people have been killed in Myanmar as aid agencies raise concerns over the spread of disease and access to essentials across the country. Mr Konyndyk said the first five days after a disaster was the key time-frame for finding people alive. ""The US has missed that window, and the cost of that is lost lives of people who could have been saved in Myanmar,"" he said. Adam Simpson, a senior lecturer in international studies at the University of South Australia, told the ABC the US contribution ""compared unfavourably"" with the 225 USAID workers and $US185 million sent to Türkiye and Syria after the earthquake there in 2023. ""The Trump administration's paltry efforts in this regard are an insult to the people of Myanmar,"" he said. ""These puny contributions are also a neat demonstration of the waning global influence and soft power of the US."" What have other countries sent? Immediately after the earthquake, Myanmar's isolated military junta issued a rare plea for international help. China responded by sending about 200 rescue specialists, with the first group arriving the day after the earthquake. According to Chinese state media, they had pulled at least eight survivors from the rubble of damaged buildings as of Tuesday morning. Beijing has also pledged about $US14 million in emergency aid. On Tuesday, Chinese foreign affairs spokesperson Mao Ning posted a video on X of the Chinese team's efforts with the line: ""China, a friend in need"". Moscow sent two aircraft with more than 120 rescuers, medics and sniffer dogs who arrived on Sunday. Other countries with rescue teams already in the country include India, Singapore and Malaysia. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Wednesday said a rapid response team had been mobilised through Australia Assists, to help coordinate disaster relief efforts on the ground. Senator Wong also said the government would provide an extra $7 million aid on top of $2 million announced on the weekend. Moscow sent two teams of disaster response experts. (Reuters: Russian Emergencies Ministry) The death knell for USAID The earthquake rocked Myanmar just as the Trump administration was announcing its final cuts to USAID, which has in the past organised the country's responses to disasters overseas. USAID's remaining programs are being folded into the US State Department. According to the New York Times, staff in USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance received agency-wide lay-off emails as they were preparing a response to the earthquake. ""We are reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. ""We are continuing essential lifesaving programs and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country."" Myanmar dictator cloaks country in darkest hour Multiple Western aid agencies said they have struggled to get personnel into Myanmar as the ruling junta leads the response to the country's largest natural disaster in years. Ms Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said on Friday USAID had ""maintained a team of disaster experts with the capacity to respond if disaster strikes"". On Monday, she defended the US's response. ""I would reject the notion this is obviously a result of the USAID cuts,"" she said. ""We're certainly in the region. ""I would reject the premise that the sign of success is that we are physically there. ""The fact that we've got partners that we work with, that our goals can be achieved through the work that we do with others around the world, is something,"" she added. The earthquake damaged countless important historic and religious buildings. (Reuters) Mr Konyndyk said that was ""gaslighting"". ""This [Myanmar response] is nothing like what the US has done in the past under Republican and Democratic administrations,"" he said. ""This is just a total withdrawal of the US from this prominent leadership role that we've had in the world."" Mr Konyndyk said the US helped design the system that countries use to respond to massive disasters and had historically been a leader in response and recovery. He said previous emergencies, including the 2015 earthquake in Nepal that he helped manage, saw the US tip in millions of dollars worth of shelter, water sanitation, emergency food, aid and other relief supplies. Millions estimated to die following Trump's aid freeze There are fears millions of people could die from preventable diseases after Donald Trump signed an executive order halting billions of dollars worth of USAID. ""The team that's going in is really just a small assessment team,"" he said. ""Very good, capable people, but nothing like the significant deployment that the US government would routinely do after any major natural disaster in the past."" Mr Konyndyk said for decades the US had led the world in global disaster response. ""It has really been a point of pride for the American people. It has been a strong symbol of both America's goodwill around the world and our solidarity with people who are suffering, but it's also a form of power projection. ""The fact that we can have the best search and rescue teams in the world, on site, anywhere in the word within a short window after a major disaster, helping to save lives, that is a really strong signal of American capability and that has now been destroyed."" Thousands of people have been forced to take shelter in makeshift camps following the earthquake. (Reuters) A 'you're on your own' message Dr Simpson, from the University of South Australia, said the US would remain a major global power and economy for some time — and a change of tack could turn its fortunes around. ""But the evidence of its trajectory towards isolation and diminution in global trade and politics is irrefutable,"" he said. Dr Simpson said since World War II the US had generally been a ""significant force"" in the international community supporting democratic ideals and women's rights. ""This is no longer the case,"" he said. ""It shouldn't need saying that if China or Russia supplants the US as the go-to international player in times of crisis there will be little emphasis on democratic principles or human rights accompanying any support. ""Other governments in South-East Asia will, as with the rest of the world, continue to work with the US and Trump administration to provide a counterbalance to China, but it will be out of necessity rather than genuine affection and admiration."" In Mr Konyndyk's view, the step back by the US in response to the Myanmar earthquake should be a wake-up call to the rest of the world, including Australia. ""It's a 'you're on your own, don't look to us for help' message,"" he said.

(Bangkok) – Myanmar’s military junta should allow immediate …","Myanmar: Allow Immediate Aid to Quake-Stricken Areas (Bangkok) – Myanmar’s military junta should allow immediate unfettered access to humanitarian aid for earthquake survivors and lift restrictions that impede the emergency response, Human Rights Watch said today. Since the earthquake struck at 12:50 p.m. on March 28, 2025, the military has carried out airstrikes and limited internet access in severely affected areas, further complicating the humanitarian response. The earthquake struck central Myanmar, toppling buildings and damaging roads and bridges. The epicenter was in Sagaing Region, close to Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay, and the capital, Naypyidaw. The Myanmar military reported that more than 1,700 people had died, although estimates by the US Geological Survey suggest a possible death toll of 10,000 or higher. “Myanmar’s military junta still invokes fear, even in the wake of a horrific natural disaster that killed and injured thousands,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The junta needs to break from its appalling past practice and ensure that humanitarian aid quickly reaches those whose lives are at risk in earthquake-affected areas.” Days after the earthquake, people remain trapped in the rubble as family members and volunteer rescue workers desperately search for survivors with no machinery or safety equipment. In Sagaing, the regional capital, rescuers have run out of body bags and the city is filled with the odor of decaying corpses. “The bodies for volunteers to cremate are piling up,” said a rescue worker in a report shared with Human Rights Watch. “Even if they cremate a body every three minutes, they would have to work around the clock.” Local journalists, humanitarian organizations, and social media report that many affected areas are without electricity and clean water. There are reported shortages of gasoline in both Mandalay and Sagaing cities. Food and other essential goods are in short supply because shops and markets have been closed. Across central Myanmar, people are sleeping outside and are in urgent need of shelter. Within hours of the earthquake, the junta requested international assistance and declared an emergency in six states and regions. Large swathes of the country affected by the earthquake are under control of the anti-junta opposition or are contested. Information from these areas is limited due to military restrictions, including internet shutdowns, bans on VPNs, and popular social media platforms, including Facebook. Several countries and international agencies have offered assistance, with foreign rescue teams reaching Mandalay and Naypyidaw within days. Although the junta indicated that all assistance was welcome, emergency workers from Taiwan were refused entry. A junta spokesperson also said that foreign media would not be allowed to report on the earthquake from inside the country. In Sagaing, local media have reported restrictions imposed by local junta authorities, the military, and affiliated militia, requiring community members to seek authorization to respond to the earthquake by submitting lists of volunteers and items to be donated. The junta has not lifted curfews that have been in place since the Covid-19 pandemic, hindering rescue efforts. Even prior to the earthquake, humanitarian needs had surged in central Myanmar where opposition groups have been fighting Myanmar security forces and allied militias since the February 2021 coup. In December 2024, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated the number of people in need of assistance was 2.1 million in Mandalay Region and 2.7 million in Sagaing Region. Prior to the earthquake, nearly 1.35 million people had been displaced in the two regions according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). A humanitarian worker told Human Rights Watch that people who had fled fighting and sought shelter in monasteries, convents, and other religious buildings have been displaced yet again due to earthquake damage to these structures. Earthquake survivors also face risks from dislodged landmines, which often shift during natural disasters. Hospitals in central Myanmar are overwhelmed with those injured. The country’s healthcare system has deteriorated since the coup, with shortages of medical supplies and personnel. Local media reported that the junta had recently closed seven private hospitals in Mandalay because they had hired doctors and other medical staff from the civil disobedience movement. In previous natural disasters, including Cyclone Mocha in 2023 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the Myanmar military has refused to authorize travel and visas for aid workers, release urgently needed supplies from customs and warehouses, and relax onerous and unnecessary restrictions on lifesaving assistance. The junta is obligated under international human rights law to uphold the rights to life, health, and shelter. Under international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflict areas, Myanmar’s military and opposition armed groups are obligated to facilitate rapid and unimpeded impartial humanitarian assistance to all civilians in need and cannot withhold consent for relief operations on arbitrary grounds. Donors should rapidly support the earthquake response while seeking ways to channel aid through independent local groups, rather than only through junta authorities, given the military’s track record of corruption and misuse of disaster assistance funding and materiel. Effective aid delivery hinges on engaging local partners that have the networks and experience to navigate a difficult environment and reach those most in need, Human Rights Watch said. “Myanmar’s junta cannot be trusted to respond to a disaster of this scale,” Lau said. “Concerned governments and international agencies need to press the junta to allow full and immediate access to survivors wherever they are.” Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights violations and save lives around the world.

"More than 1,000 killed in Myanmar earthquake as search efforts continue","Myanmar, also known as Burma, is in the throes of a prolonged and bloody civil war, which is already responsible for a massive humanitarian crisis.","Watch CBS News A unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts was announced on Saturday by Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military. The country's death toll from the disaster soared to 1,644. The figure was a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 announced just hours earlier, highlighting the difficulty of confirming casualties over a widespread region and the likelihood that the numbers will continue to grow from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok. Of the death toll, 10 were killed in the high rise building near famous Chatuchak market that collapsed, while the rest were killed in seven other sites. Authorities in Bangkok said 83 people were unaccounted for. On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and relatives. ""I was praying that that they had survived, but when I got here and saw the ruin — where could they be? said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site. In Myanmar, rescue efforts so far are focused on the major stricken cities of Mandalay, the country's No. 2 city, and Naypyitaw, the capital. But even though teams and equipment have been flown in from other nations, they are hindered by damage to airports. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base. It wasn't immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse. Francesco Capoluongo, from the International Federation of the Red Cross in Myanmar, told the BBC that with more than 18 million people living within the earthquake's impacted area, they expect the death toll to keep increasing. ""The search and rescue is still ongoing,"" she said. ""It's very difficult now to validate any figure, and we know that it will continue to increase and (that) many of these 18 million people are now without safe shelter, access to clean water, reliable health care."" Myanmar, also known as Burma, is in the throes of a prolonged and bloody civil war, which is already responsible for a massive humanitarian crisis. It makes movement around the country both difficult and dangerous, complicating relief efforts and raising fears that the death toll could still rise precipitously. On Saturday night, Myanmar's National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military, announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. It said in a statement that its armed wing, the People's Defense Force will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas. It said it would ""collaborate with the U.N. and non-governmental organizations to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,"" in its controlled areas. The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks including one measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads, caused bridges to collapse and burst a dam. In the capital Naypyidaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday. The government said more than 1,590 houses were damaged in the Mandalay region, the epicenter of the earthquake. Destruction in Thailand In neighboring Thailand, the death toll increased to 10. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok, the capital. Nine of the fatalities were at the site of the collapsed high-rise under construction near Bangkok's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for. On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and family members of the missing that they would be found alive. ""I was praying that that they had survived but when I got here and saw the ruin — where could they be? In which corner? Are they still alive? I am still praying that all six are alive,"" said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site. ""I cannot accept this. When I see this I can't accept this. A close friend of mine is in there, too,"" she said. Waenphet Panta said she hadn't heard from her daughter Kanlayanee since a phone call about an hour before the quake. A friend told her Kanlayanee had been working high on the building on Friday. ""I am praying my daughter is safe, that she has survived and that she's at the hospital,"" she said, Kanlayanee's father sitting beside her. Thai authorities said the quake and aftershocks were felt in most of the country's provinces. Many places in the north reported damage to residential buildings, hospitals and temples, including in Chiang Mai, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok International aid arrives as rescuers ask for help After more than 24 hours of desperate searching, many exhausted rescue workers are asking for some relief. ""We have been here since last night. We haven't got any sleep. More help is needed here,"" the rescue worker told AFP. ""We have enough manpower but we don't have enough cars. We are transporting dead bodies using light trucks. About 10-20 bodies in one light truck."" In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept outside assistance. China and Russia, the largest suppliers of weapons to Myanmar's military, were among the first to step in with humanitarian aid. China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits and generators and pledged some $13.8 million in emergency humanitarian aid. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies. India also sent a search and rescue team and a medical team while Malaysia said it would send 50 people on Sunday. South Korea said it would provide $2 million worth of humanitarian aid through international organizations, and the U.N. allocated $5 million to start relief efforts. Hong Kong sent a group of 51 search-and-rescue personnel to help with earthquake relief efforts in Myanmar. The group includes firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs, among others. President Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response. Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he'd already spoken to the country's officials and ""It's a real bad one, and we will be helping."" However, some experts were concerned about this effort given his administration's deep cuts in foreign assistance. Natural disaster on top of civil war Myanmar's military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones. Military forces continued their attacks even after the quake, with three airstrikes in northern Kayin state, also called Karenni state, and southern Shan — both of which border Mandalay state, said Dave Eubank, a former U.S. Special Forces soldier who founded the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian aid organization that has provided assistance to both combatants and civilians in Myanmar since the 1990s. Eubank told The Associated Press that in the area he was operating in, most villages had already been destroyed by the military so the earthquake had little impact. ""People are in the jungle and I was out in the jungle when the earthquake hit — it was powerful, but the trees just moved, that was it for us, so we haven't had a direct impact other than that the Burma army keeps attacking, even after the quake,"" he said. In northern Shan, an airstrike on a rebel-controlled village just minutes after the earthquake killed seven militia members and damaged five buildings, including a school, Mai Rukow, editor of a Shan-based online media Shwe Phee Myay News Agency, told the AP. Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations. ""Although a full picture of the damage is still emerging, most of us have never seen such destruction,"" said Haider Yaqub, Myanmar country director for the NGO Plan International, from Yangon. ""Without a doubt, the humanitarian needs will be significant.""

The structure is inspired by an old sea mark – a beacon. The top of the building is at about the same level as the sea was when the first people started to inhabit Holmön. Each division of the facade represents 100 years of land uplift.

"Over 1,700 Dead in Devastating Southeast Asia Earthquake","The official death toll from Friday’s magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar passed 1,700, but total casualties are probably much higher.
The post Over 1,700 Dead in Devastating Southeast Asia Earthquake appeared first on Breitbart.","The official death toll from Friday’s magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar has officially passed 1,700, but humanitarian groups and United Nations officials warned on Monday that total casualties are probably much higher than the government tally. Hundreds of people are still trapped under debris, and rescue efforts are hindered by several factors, including the state of civil war that exists in the country. “Even before this earthquake, nearly 20 million people in Myanmar were in need of humanitarian assistance,” U.N. humanitarian coordinator Marcoluigi Corsi said Monday. “This latest tragedy compounds an already dire crisis and risks further eroding the resilience of communities already battered by conflict, displacement, and past disasters,” Corsi said. The U.N. hinted at the political instability in Myanmar by demanding “unimpeded humanitarian access for humanitarian convoys, medical personnel, and assessment teams to all affected regions, regardless of location or control.” Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma, has been ruled by a military junta since February 2021. An armed insurgency against the junta began soon after the civilian government was overthrown. As Corsi’s report indicated, Myanmar’s civilian population was already in crisis before the devastating quake struck on Friday. The U.N. estimates over three million people have been displaced by the fighting, which continued even after the earthquake. Many of those refugees had sought shelter in the areas that suffered the worst damage from the quake. The junta conducted airstrikes against rebel positions on Sunday, for example. Insurgent leaders and human rights groups accused the junta of taking advantage of the earthquake to launch major air strikes against the rebels while they were disoriented from the tragedy. “Reports that Myanmar’s military has continued with airstrikes after the earthquake tells you everything you need to know about the junta – obsessed with its brutal repression of civilians and desperately trying to win the war whatever the human cost,” Human Rights Watch (HRW) Asia director Elaine Pearson said on Saturday. Pearson was responding to a BBC report that quoted U.N. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews denouncing the junta airstrikes as “completely outrageous and unacceptable.” Andrews said it was “nothing short of incredible” that the junta would “drop bombs when you are trying to rescue people.” “Anyone who has influence on the military needs to step up the pressure and make it very clear that this is not acceptable. I’m calling upon the junta to just stop, stop any of its military operations,” he said. Andrews warned the junta could limit relief efforts as a means of weakening its adversaries. “What we know from past humanitarian disasters, natural disasters, is that the junta does not reveal the truth. It also has a habit of blocking humanitarian aid from getting to where it is most needed,” he said. “They weaponize this aid. They send it to those areas that they have control of and they deny it to areas that they do not,” he charged. The deposed civilian government of Myanmar, known as the National Unity Government (NUG), announced that its own forces would begin a two-week pause in “offensive military operations, except for defensive actions” on Sunday. The BBC said the junta is desperate after “continual and humiliating defeats” that left it with control over “less than a quarter of the country.” The only real military advantage the junta has left is air power, which it tends to use with great enthusiasm and very little regard for civilian casualties. Human rights groups blasted Russia and China for supporting the junta by providing it with the warplanes to conduct its relentless bombing campaign. These critics dismissed the humanitarian aid belatedly sent by Moscow and Beijing as far less important than the bombs and aircraft they previously sent to Myanmar. “It’s hard to trust the sympathy now, when they’re also the same countries supplying the military junta with deadly weapons used to kill our innocent civilians,” U.K.-based activist Julie Khine told the BBC. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) said at least three hospitals were completely destroyed by the earthquake, and 22 more were damaged, putting further strain upon an already overwhelmed health care system. “The earthquake’s devastation has overwhelmed health care facilities in the affected areas, which are struggling to manage the influx of injured individuals. There is an urgent need for trauma and surgical care, blood transfusion supplies, anesthetics, essential medicines, and mental health support,” W.H.O. said. Adding to the urgency of the earthquake disaster is that monsoon season is only a month away and monsoon flooding tends to displace large numbers of people. Those refugees will have even more trouble than usual finding shelter due to the enormous damage from the quake. Meanwhile, the government of Thailand is investigating the collapse of a Chinese-built high-rise office building during the earthquake. The entire building came down in a matter of seconds, killing at least ten people and trapping dozens of construction workers beneath tons of debris. China sent a team to investigate the collapse, but Thai officials suggested the Chinese were more interested in securing documents from the disaster area than figuring out why the supposedly earthquake-proof structure came down like a house of cards. The 33-story building building was still under construction when shock waves from the earthquake reached Bangkok, which is over 600 miles from the epicenter of the quake in Myanmar. The $58 million construction project began three years ago. When completed, the building was to serve as headquarters for the Thai State Audit Office (SAO). Thai engineers immediately began asking how the building could have collapsed so quickly. “You see all other buildings, even high-rise buildings under construction, they are safe. So either the design was wrong or construction was wrong, but it’s too soon to reach conclusions,” Thai civil engineer and politician Suchatchavee Suwansawas said. Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who is also the interior minister of Thailand, formed a committee to investigate the destruction of the high-rise on Sunday. An inspection team from the Ministry of Industry has already visited the site to determine whether low-quality steel or poor design decisions factored into the collapse. “The earthquake caused a seismic magnitude of 7.8 but more than 95% of buildings withstood it. Collapse happened only to the State Audit building,” Anutin said. Anutin said he met with a Chinese earthquake expert who was dispatched by Chinese Ambassador Han Zhiqiang to the disaster area on Sunday. However, the Thai deputy prime minister made it clear that Chinese personnel would not be allowed to enter the ruins of the building. On Sunday, Thai police detained four Chinese nationals for illegally entering the ruins of the skyscraper and attempting to retrieve a cache of 32 documents from the rubble. One of the detainees identified himself as the project manager for the construction project, and said the documents were needed to file an insurance claim. On Monday, the head of an anti-corruption watchdog group in Thailand said dozens of irregularities in the Chinese-led construction project have been reported over the past three years. Anti-Corruption Organization of Thailand president Mana Nimitmongkol said the tower was originally supposed to be completed by 2026, but due to inexplicable delays and worker shortages was only about 30 percent complete when the earthquake brought it down. The Thai government was so frustrated by these delays that it threatened to cancel the project earlier this year. “Sometimes the number of workers on site were much fewer than there should be, causing delays. Potentially there was a rush to complete the project towards the end, which could cause a drop in the standard of work,” Mana said.

'Sheer volume' of floodwater astounds as rescuers share incredible survival story,Graziers have recounted the moment they found a man who had been missing for a few days after becoming stuck in western Queensland floodwater.,"Disaster relief payments open for flooded outback Queensland residents ABC Western Qld Topic:Floods In short: More flooded western Queensland residents face the prospect of having to be evacuated. A man has been rescued after becoming lost for two days when his car became bogged in floodwater. What's next? People affected by the disaster can now apply for financial support through Services Australia. Daniel Roy has had a bird's eye view of the devastating flooding that has cut through outback Queensland, including in his tiny town of Thargomindah, 1,100 kilometres west of Brisbane. He has been using his drone camera to document the nearby Bulloo River's rapid rise. The river has reached well above the 1974 flood record. Tash Dare was among the Thargomindah residents who slept in their cars at the airport. (Supplied) ""Just the sheer volume of water, it's just gone everywhere … it's now pushed into the majority of the town,"" Mr Roy said. ""There's no weather systems out here so having the drone up has just helped a lot of people see what's happening to their properties and in some ways come to terms with the damages a lot quicker."" Mr Roy grew up on the Gold Coast, while his partner was from Brisbane. He said they were amazed by the generosity and resilience of Thargomindah residents. ""We're outsiders, but we feel like family here,"" he said. Mr Roy says residents have had to make tough decisions. (Supplied) Floodwater broke through the town's makeshift levee bank on Monday morning, with 220 residents forced to flee to higher ground. Dozens spent a restless night at the local airport, sleeping in their cars or on swags. Voluntary evacuations began on Tuesday, with residents flown to the nearby town of Charleville. Grazier Anthony Glasson, from Picarilli Station south of Thargomindah, offered to take in evacuees. At least 100,000 head of livestock feared lost in Queensland floods More than 100,000 cattle and sheep are estimated to be dead or missing in the devastating flooding continuing in outback Queensland. ""Where our homestead is, we haven't got an issue,"" he said. He said about 20,000 hectares of his property was underwater or about to go underwater. ""We've got beds here, we could have up to 25 people,"" Mr Glasson said. ""We're working to get them choppered over the river and we can pick them up."" The Bureau of Meteorology said the remnants of ex-Tropical Cyclone Dianne would bring about 50mm of rain to already drenched western communities. The levee bank was unable to prevent floodwater from inundating homes. (Supplied: Daniel Roy) 'Help' sign leads to missing man Meanwhile, an incredible story of survival has emerged from the disaster, which has resulted in an area double the size of Victoria being engulfed by floodwater. A young couple helped rescue a man who was missing for two days after his four-wheel drive became bogged in floodwater about 200 kilometres south-east of Charleville. A search and rescue mission was launched on Friday after the man failed to return home. Bronte and Max, whose last names have been withheld for privacy reasons, manage a 60,000-hectare cattle and goat station. Bronte and Max helped track down the man, who ended up near their station. (Supplied: Lifeflight) They had gone to check on their fences on Sunday when they noticed large letters scrawled onto the muddy road, spelling 'HELP'. ""It gives me the shivers when I think about the sign he drew … if he hadn't done that we wouldn't have found him,"" Bronte said. Near the sign were arrows which led to a makeshift shelter. ""I pulled up and said are you *John? (name withheld for privacy reasons). He said, 'Yes' and I said, 'My God do you know that you're a missing person and everyone is looking for you',"" Bronte said. The man had made a shelter in a paddock out of discarded items. (Supplied: LifeFlight) The man told the couple he had survived on protein drinks. LifeFlight paramedic Aaron Hartle said they flew the man, who was dehydrated and delirious, to Charleville Hospital where he was reunited with his family. ""He's probably walked about 60 kilometres trying to find help. He was extremely tired and absolutely wrecked,"" Mr Hartle said. Emergency crews have been helping evacuate residents. (Supplied: Queensland Police Service) Disaster support Natural disaster relief been activated for people living in western Queensland affected by the record rain and flooding. Financial support claims can be made online, through the Services Australia website. The state government has also appointed Stuart Mackenzie OAM as State Recovery Coordinator, to lead rebuilding efforts. Thargomindah residents wade through floodwater after being told to go to higher ground. (Supplied: Daniel Roy) Mr Mackenzie is a grazier who has also served as a councillor, deputy mayor and mayor of the Quilpie Shire Council. Premier David Crisafulli said Mr Mackenzie would serve alongside Queensland Police Service's Chief Superintendent, Emergency Management and Coordination Command, Troy Pukallus, as the Deputy State Recovery Coordinator. ""We have appointed two people with decades of experience who know and understand what locals need best,"" Mr Crisafulli said. ""Western Queenslanders are resilient, and this is about matching that attitude with action to ensure they can recover and rebuild as quickly as possible.""

"US says team on way to quake-hit Myanmar, defends pace","WASHINGTON: The United States said Monday (Mar 31) it has dispatched a disaster relief team to Myanmar days after a major earthquake, defending the pace of the deployment follow","World US says team on way to quake-hit Myanmar, defends pace In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, rescuers carry out search and rescue on the damaged buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake in Mandalay, Mar 31, 2025. (Photo: Xinhua via AP/Jiang Chao) WASHINGTON: The United States said Monday (Mar 31) it has dispatched a disaster relief team to Myanmar days after a major earthquake, defending the pace of the deployment following President Donald Trump's dismantling of America's main overseas aid agency. The United States has announced US$2 million in support to aid organisations on the ground in Myanmar, where the earthquake death toll has surpassed 2000. ""A US aid team of humanitarian experts based in the region are traveling to Burma now to identify the people's most pressing needs, including emergency shelter, food, medical needs and access to water,"" State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters, using Myanmar's old name. The earthquake struck Friday, on the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was formally dissolving the US Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that the ""gains were too few and the costs were too high"", after cutting more than 80 per cent of its projects. China, Russia and India have already sent teams to Myanmar. Historically the United States, under the guidance of USAID, has swiftly dispatched rescue teams and relief around the world following earthquakes and other natural disasters. Asked if the US response was slower than usual, Bruce said: ""I would reject the notion that this is obviously a result of the USAID cuts and that kind of funding. There are many different elements to this dynamic."" She did not elaborate but said that the United States ""finally"" had a formal request from Myanmar, whose military-run government is under heavy sanctions by Washington. She also said that the US$2 million was going directly to organisations already on the ground. In 2008, when Myanmar was also under military rule and hit by a devastating cyclone, the US military managed to air-lift in 500,000kg of relief goods. Myanmar's junta has long been close to China. The United States had sought to gain influence in Myanmar as it transitioned to democracy, but the opening abruptly ended in February 2021 when the military toppled the civilian leadership.

Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake, among the biggest to jolt the Southeast Asian nation in the last century, crippled airports, bridges and highways amid a civil war that has wrecked the economy and displaced millions. The death toll in Myanmar climbed to 1,644, the military government said on Saturday, according to BBC Burmese news service. In neighboring Thailand, where the quake rattled buildings and brought down a skyscraper under construction in the capital Bangkok, at least nine people were killed. Survivors in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-biggest city, dug with their bare hands on Friday in desperate attempts to save those still trapped, lacking heavy machinery and with authorities absent. In Bangkok on Saturday, rescue operations continued at the site of the 33-story tower's collapse, where 47 people were missing or trapped under the rubble - including workers from Myanmar. The U.S. Geological Service's predictive modeling estimated Myanmar's death toll could exceed 10,000 and losses could exceed the country's annual economic output. A day after making a rare call for international assistance, Myanmar's junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, travelled to hard-hit Mandalay near the epicenter of the quake, which brought down buildings and triggered fires in some areas. ""The Chairman of the State Administration Council instructed authorities to expedite search and rescue efforts and address any urgent needs,"" the junta said in a statement on state media, referring to Min Aung Hlaing. An initial assessment by Myanmar's opposition National Unity Government said at least 2,900 buildings, 30 roads and seven bridges had been damaged by the quake. ""Due to significant damage, Naypyitaw and Mandalay international airports are temporarily closed,"" said the NUG, which includes remnants of the elected civilian government ousted by the military in a 2021 coup that triggered the civil war. The control tower at the airport in Naypyitaw, Myanmar's purpose-built capital city, collapsed, rendering it inoperable, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. A Myanmar junta spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment. Hospitals in central and northwestern Myanmar were struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, warning that damage to roads was hindering access. Seventeen cargo trucks of shelter and medical supplies were due to arrive on Sunday to address shortages of medicines, including blood bags and anesthetics, the agency added. A Chinese rescue team arrived at the airport in Myanmar's commercial capital of Yangon, hundreds of kilometres from Mandalay and Naypyitaw, and will travel upcountry by bus, state media said. Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone with the junta chief, China's embassy in Myanmar said on Saturday, and said Beijing would provide $13.77 million worth of aid, including tents, blankets and emergency medical kits. The United States, which has a testy relationship with the Myanmar military and has sanctioned its officials, including Min Aung Hlaing, has said it would provide some assistance. Relief supplies from India on a military aircraft also landed in Yangon, according to Myanmar state media, and India's government said it was also dispatching ships with 40 tonnes of humanitarian aid. Russia, Malaysia and Singapore were also sending planeloads of relief supplies and personnel. Residents in the hardest-hit areas are desperate for the help. The quake, which hit around lunchtime on Friday, affected wide swathes of Myanmar, from the central plains around Mandalay to the hills of Shan in the east, parts of which are not completely under the junta's control. Rescue operations in Mandalay could not match the scale of the disaster, one resident said by phone, asking not to be named because of security concerns. ""Many people are trapped but there is no help coming just simply because there isn't manpower or equipment or vehicles,"" he said. In Bangkok, 1,000 km (620 miles) from the epicenter, authorities on Saturday pushed ahead with efforts to find construction workers trapped under the rubble of the collapsed tower, using excavators, drones and search-and-rescue dogs. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said all possible resources had been deployed to search for survivors and to bring out bodies of the deceased. ""We always have hope,"" he told reporters. ""We're still working around the clock."" Chanpen Kaewnoi, 39, said she rushed over on Friday afternoon after seeing news reports that the under-construction building where her mother and younger sister were working had collapsed. ""I called my sister, but no matter how many times I tried to call her there was no connection,"" she said after a sleepless night at the site. ""I want to wait for my mother and sister,"" said Chanpen, herself a construction worker, ""I want to see their faces again."" Across the sprawling metropolis, where such quakes are rare, there may be up to 5,000 damaged buildings, including residential towers, said Anek Siripanichgorn, a board member of Council of Engineers Thailand, which is helping municipal authorities. ""We are going through hundreds of cases,"" he said. ""If we see cases where there is potential danger, we will immediately send engineers."" Your Dream Job in Shinjuku Teach, lead, and inspire!

I was working at US Forces Japan during Operation Tomodachi, the US response to the Mar 2011 earthquake and tsunami. We formed a joint US military-USAID team to provide a full range of support to the Japanese government. It was perhaps the US's most successful disaster response effort - and the appreciation from ordinary Japanese citizens then, and today, continues to amaze me... In less than 60 days, Trump and Musk have gutted our ability to stage such an operation.

Because folks easily forgot what good the US did, but always remembered what bad the US did. And the US did a lot of bad things all over the world in the name of fighting communism during the Cold War. USAID is a Cold War relic and should be relegated to where it belongs, in the dustbin. Unless you want to throw more good money after bad. Because we're a Christian nation, right? I thought that the liberals claimed they believed in secularism. Must have been wrong. So let China gain even more influence...first Putin, now Xi...who's the next tyrant to get some MAGA-love? China already has a lot of influence in Myanmar, and that's because the Biden administration chose the path of sanctions whereas China chose to be in the good books of the Tatmadaw. Japan and India have been trying to counter China's influence but Japan also sanctioned Myanmar after being pressurized by the Biden administration. The remaining country which has been trying to counter China's influence in Myanmar is India, but the US liberals dislike India as well so can't blame Trump for all of that.

Just spoke to a friend of mine, he got lucky half of his neighborhood is gone, but his building and 3 others weren’t that badly damaged but still severe enough. Makes you wonder if Japan will ever get hit like that in any of the major cities. We had a big one years ago and it was massive, Fukuoka sustained a lot of damage it was crazy, if I recall correctly, I think it was bigger, around 17 years ago, the shaking was a J-wave and it was just pure terror for almost 25 seconds, I just don’t wish this kind of disaster on anyone Used to be ""the world was shrinking ""...meaning all nations were closer. Now ? Dont want to speculate. ”Used to be ""the world was shrinking ""...meaning all nations were closer. Now ? Dont want to speculate.” Shrinking never, aging yes, the aging process was divided into 12 equal parts, having said that I also hate to speculate but most probably we are doing the twelve part already. The frequent floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanoes including the demise of the nuclear family are some of the indicators of the last part． Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

A Hiker's Path: Morgan County's Burkhart Creek park provides serenity,Hiking columnist Susan Anderson recently spent a chilly day observing Burkhart Creek in Morgan County.,"A Hiker's Path: Morgan County's Burkhart Creek park provides serenity Spring is trying so hard to arrive, but the day I hiked at Burkhart Creek County Park, it felt more like a burst of winter. There was a chill in the air and a jacket was required, and the wind was pretty strong. Still, it’s a beautiful place to hike. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources donated an 83-acre parcel of land to Morgan County a few years ago. Along with help from Indiana Power and Light, the county gained a beautiful and special nature park. This site is held as a natural, low impact park for county residents. The Burkhart Creek County Park has a native plant area and an improved wetland area with winding, level trails, and one or two steep trails for additional exercise. The park includes shelter houses, parking areas, and hiking trails. Just a mile north of Paragon and a few miles into the country, this park might very well be one of Morgan County’s best kept secrets. I drove to the park early one afternoon, parked in the parking lot and started out for a day of exploration. All of the trails intersect at different places, but the creek was my main destination on this day. I headed down the trail in front of me parallel to the creek. I followed the path to the first intersection where I made a right turn. With a short few steps, I was in front of Burkhart Creek. What a picture-worthy day it was on the creek's banks. The sun was shining despite the chilly wind. I took several pictures of the creek, with a backdrop of the sun and the blue skies overhead. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. I felt myself relax. I was in my element. There wasn’t much green in the landscape yet. It was still March after all. We’ve had all kinds of crazy weather, but it made no difference to me. I was still out in nature. I had read that a pioneer family by the last name of Grounds had homesteaded the property from 1852 until 1976. I felt it was fitting the land is now set aside for this beautiful park. Burkhart Creek runs through the whole property. On the creek banks, there are many serene places to sit and meditate. I was at my most favorite one. There’s a tree in this area that I have named “the sitting tree."" The trunk of the tree goes upward in three directions, leaving sort of a flat spot in the middle and it’s just perfect for sitting on. So I perched there and enjoyed listening to the sounds of nature around me. I saw and heard more than a few birds in this area and heard the call of a pileated woodpecker. There are a few fossils and small geodes that can be found along the creek banks. I love to hunt for rocks. so I spent some time picking up rocks and looking for fossils. I enjoyed my hike and knew that I would be back soon. It’s a great place to escape for some peace and quiet! This little park is hidden away from the mainstream traffic. It’s right across the road from Ravina Woods, a 1,500-acre plot of forest that belongs to the Morgan-Monroe State Forest. It, too, is open to the public. The park is open from dawn til dusk. Admission is free. To get to this place: Watch for the park sign on Ind. 67 about a mile north of Paragon at Duckworth Road. Follow the signs from there. Parking is available on both Duckworth Road and Warthen Road. A quote for your week: “I don’t have any regrets because I think life is like a creek. It kind of meanders along, and you instinctively do the things that you are meant to do.” Sissy Spacek — American actressUntil the next trail, Susan",https://www.spencereveningworld.com/story/sports/2025/04/02/intersecting-trails-make-burkhart-creek-county-park-worth-a-visit/82702789007/,2025-04-02T08:45:37Z

Set against the jagged mountains north of the Palm Springs Visitor Center at Tramway Road, the sculpture gestures toward shelter without ever quite providing it. A geometric canopy of interlocking triangles floats overhead. It forms a porous roof that offers no escape from the sunlight, wind, and dust, but instead opens viewers up to them while casting shifting shadows on the desert floor below. It’s a structure that speaks of Palm Springs’ iconic modernism and its promises of protection, yet delivers only the illusion of safety. In this minimalist pavilion, Kapwani Kiwanga weaves the legacy of the Underground Railroad into the fabric of Desert X. The roof pattern, drawn from the ‘flying geese’ quilting motif, transforms into a cipher of survival. Historically, these quilts served as covert navigation tools — hung from porches and lines, their patterns silently signaling safe passage north for enslaved people seeking freedom. In this context, Kiwanga’s sculpture is a rest stop in a speculative journey, a place to pause and reflect amidst the harsh and historically fraught landscape. Desert X 2025 will be on view in the Coachella Valley until May 11th, 2025 — see designboom’s coverage here. images © Lance Gerber kapwani kiwanga critiques midcentury desert architecture Kapwani Kiwanga’s work for Desert X 2025 is built on the push and pull between endurance and fragility. Columns made from imported stone and local palm fronds support the overhead lattice, emphasizing contrasts — what is transported and what is native, what stands firm and what yields. The piece offers a counterpoint to the polished optimism of midcentury desert architecture, revealing the darker subtext of exclusion that accompanied its aesthetics. Beneath the clean lines and open spaces were legal and social structures that barred access to safety and ownership for many. Kiwanga’s sculpture surfaces this complexity with quiet power. With Plotting Rest, the artist contributes to Desert X’s ongoing interrogation of land, time, and migration. Her work reminds visitors that the desert has always been a place of movement — for pioneers, migrants, and those forced to flee. While Manifest Destiny expanded the nation westward, others were moving northward under duress, chasing an uncertain freedom. Kiwanga’s sculpture captures this tension: the dream of a better life etched into a place where shelter is both symbol and mirage. Kapwani Kiwanga’s Plotting Rest is installed in the desert north of Palm Springs for Desert X 2025 the Landscape of Desert X 2025 Kapwani Kiwanga’s installation is one of eleven new commissions in Desert X 2025, a biennial that turns the vast and remote landscape into a sprawling exhibition of site-responsive public art. Other notable works include To Breathe — Coachella Valley by Kimsooja, which uses light and diffraction to explore invisibility and perception, and Adobe Oasis by Ronald Rael, a speculative habitat that merges ancestral building methods with environmental resilience. Together, these pieces introduce a dialogue with the desert’s past and future, reflecting themes of Indigenous futurism, climate resistance, and the porous boundaries between the built and natural world. the open lattice roof references Palm Springs design while offering no real shelter the sculpture acts as a symbolic rest stop for those on imagined journeys toward freedom Kiwanga uses the ‘flying geese’ quilt motif as a symbol of covert navigation during the Underground Railroad materials like imported stone and local palm fronds emphasize contrasts between permanence and fragility Plotting Rest critiques the exclusionary history behind midcentury desert architecture the work evokes historical patterns of migration and displacement across the American landscape project info: name: Plotting Rest artist: Kapwani Kiwanga event: Desert X | @_desertx location: Coachella Valley, California dates: March 8th — May 11th, 2025 photography: © Lance Gerber | @lance.gerber architecture in california (282) desert X (18) sculpture (416)",https://www.designboom.com/art/kapwani-kiwanga-desert-x-plotting-rest-04-02-2025/,2025-04-02T03:01:52Z
"Myanmar's junta continues airstrikes, hampering search for earthquake survivors",Junta airstrikes continued to hamper rescue workers and aid agencies trying to help the survivors of last week's massive Myanmar earthquake.,"Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Myanmar's junta continues airstrikes, hampering search for earthquake survivors Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing said the death toll is approaching 3,000. By RFA Burmese and Pimuk Rakkanam for RFA 2025.04.01 BANGKOK -- Junta airstrikes continued to hamper rescue workers and aid agencies trying to help the survivors of last week's massive Myanmar earthquake. Adding to the humanitarian crisis caused by a civil war, civilians displaced by Friday's magnitude 7.7 quake that killed more than 2,700 people are now forced to shelter from bombs as well. ""From the date of the earthquake, March 28, to yesterday, we've found that the military has launched aerial attacks eight times. Even today in the Magway area, we've seen them bombing again,"" said Moe Htet Nay, an advisor at Nyan Lin Thit Research Group, which monitors the conflict. Junta forces have bombed Shan state's Nawnghkio township three times, Kachin state's Bhamo township twice, Phyu township in Bago region, Pauk township in Magway region and Demoso township in Kayah state once each, he said Tuesday. Nine people were killed in the post-quake attacks, with seven injured nationwide, according to groups fighting the military government that seized power from elected civilians in a February 2021 coup. Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing said Tuesday the earthquake death toll has risen to 2,719 and is likely to exceed 3,000. Some 4,521 people were injured and 441 missing, he said on television. Friday's earthquake was centered near Mandalay in the middle of the country and caused severe destruction in Sagaing, Magway, Bago, Naypyidaw, Shan state and eastern Taungoo. It also rocked Thailand and other parts of the region. The junta declared a state of emergency in all the affected regions. The ousted National Unity Government and Myanmar residents said the decree has hampered rescue efforts due to a 10 p.m. curfew in many areas where civilian teams are searching for survivors. Human Rights Watch on Tuesday called on the junta to ""allow immediate unfettered access to humanitarian aid for earthquake survivors."" It said Myanmar's military rulers should lift restrictions including curfews, registration of rescue workers and internet blackouts that are slowing the emergency response. ""Myanmar's military junta still invokes fear, even in the wake of a horrific natural disaster that killed and injured thousands,"" said Bryony Lau, the group's deputy Asia director. ""The junta needs to break from its appalling past practice and ensure that humanitarian aid quickly reaches those whose lives are at risk in earthquake-affected areas,"" she said. Citing a rescue worker in the Sagaing region, Human Rights Watch said the number of bodies for volunteers to cremate is piling up. ""Even if they cremate a body every three minutes, they would have to work around the clock,"" the rescuer said, according to HRW. ""Myanmar's junta cannot be trusted to respond to a disaster of this scale,"" said Lau. ""Concerned governments and international agencies need to press the junta to allow full and immediate access to survivors wherever they are."" Hopes fade at site of Bangkok building collapse At the site of a Bangkok office tower toppled by the quake, hopes were fading for the dozens of construction workers - many of them from Myanmar - buried in the rubble of the government building. A scan of the site indicated more than 70 people still beneath the concrete and tangled steel wreckage of the state audit office near the famous Chatuchak market, Bangkok Deputy Governor Tavida Kamolvej said Tuesday. The confirmed death toll from the office collapse is 13. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has ordered an investigation into the building collapse, with some findings expected later this week. She also ordered eight government ministries to remedy their slow response to the quake's aftermath. Bangkok governor Chadchart Sittiput ordered inspections of all high-rise buildings in the capital to allay the concerns of greater Bangkok's 17 million residents. The governor on Monday rescinded the administration's designation of the city as a disaster zone, which had enhanced the powers of the emergency services. ""The impact on the public, the damage to basic infrastructure, transportation routes, and assistance in various sectors have been continuously addressed,"" he said in a statement. ""Additionally, the living conditions of most residents have returned to normal."" Amid reports of mass cancellations of hotel bookings, tourism minister Sorawong Thienthong held an emergency meeting with industry representatives and the tourism council. He said no visitors had been harmed, hotels had passed safety inspections and tourist police were monitoring key sites. Translated by Kiana Duncan. Edited by Stephen Wright and Mike Firn.

"How Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort Is Protecting Native Hawaiian Species",This luxurious property is home to endemic Hawaiian creatures spanning from shrimp to monk seals to the nēnē goose.,"ByJared Ranahan How Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort Is Protecting Native Hawaiian Species ByJared Ranahan, Contributor. Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort is equipped with more than 8,000 solar panels. Located more than 3,800 kilometers west of North America, the Hawaiian Islands are renowned worldwide for their high concentration of endemic flora and fauna, with native species spanning from the ʻanianiau to the ʻiʻiwi to the Hawaiian hoary bat—but this treasure trove of biodiversity isn’t free from existential threats. Over the centuries, introduced species have wreaked havoc across the region, competing for resources and preying on vulnerable species that have evolved to live without natural predators. However, in the wake of these issues, there’s a wealth of organizations and businesses that are working hard to ensure that Hawaiʻi’s native wildlife can flourish well into the future. On the western shore of Hawaiʻi Island, Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort acts as a crucial haven for a wide array of native species, with more than 30 hectares of carefully-preserved habitat found throughout the property. While vibrant flower gardens and towering palms can be found in abundance during a visit, the resort is best known for its high concentration of anchialine pools, a type of brackish water feature that forms in lava fields close to the ocean. This natural phenomenon forms the perfect conditions for the native ʻōpaeʻula shrimp to thrive, with the property’s groundskeeping staff ensuring that the pools are kept free from any debris or hazards that might interfere with their natural habitat. The Hawaiian monk seal is one of two extant monk seal species. Beyond these tiny crustaceans, Kona Village also plays a role in supporting a much larger native species: the Hawaiian monk seal, to be precise. While this endemic pinniped once thrived across the surrounding islands, threats today range from feral cat-induced Toxoplasmosis exposure to entanglement in discarded fishing nets, prompting the formation of conservation organizations like the nearby Ke Kai Ola, a coastal care facility that’s dedicated to the rehabilitation of injured and orphaned Hawaiian monk seals. In an effort to support the organization, Kona Village encourages guests to fish for invasive tilapia in their on-property ponds and offer them as a donation to the facility, ultimately clearing out pest organisms while supporting an indigenous species all in one fell swoop. Alongside monk seals, the property also offers shelter for a wealth of native avifauna, with the official state bird of Hawaiʻi making frequent appearances for guests. Known as the nēnē, this eye-catching goose is believed to be a close relative of the Canada goose, evolving roughly half a million years ago from an isolated population that somehow made its way to the islands. During an early morning birdwatching session, visitors can spot the waterfowl as well as other species like the Pacific golden plover, ruddy turnstone and ʻapapane—and to sweeten the deal, the property also has a steadfast commitment to sourcing local produce and protein, ensuring that each meal you enjoy across property is packed full of fresh ingredients from nearby farms. Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’ NYT Mini Today: Hints, Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 3 Nintendo Surprises With Switch 2 Price Hike—As Trump Imposes Tariffs On China And Vietnam While Hawaiʻi has long been renowned for its spectacular landscapes, each individual island comes equipped with its own unique array of flora and fauna, providing an added appeal for birdwatchers, scuba divers and all other naturalists that visit the region. Though the biodiversity of the Hawaiian Islands hangs in a delicate balance, there’s no shortage of protected havens in place to allow wildlife to flourish, with Kona Village being a prime example. From shrimp to seals to nēnē geese, this luxurious resort provides guests with the perfect opportunity to marvel at the endemic creatures that have called Hawaiʻi home for eons. The nēnē was named as the state bird of Hawaiʻi in 1957.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredranahan/2025/03/31/how-kona-village-a-rosewood-resort-is-protecting-native-hawaiian-species/,2025-03-31T22:42:42Z
Myanmar earthquake: Is aid reaching those in need?,The humanitarian situation in Myanmar remains dire following the worst earthquake to hit the country in over a century. Doubts abound about the ruling military junta's ability to facilitate aid. International aid has been pouring in to Myanmar since a massive…,"International aid has been pouring into Myanmar since a massive 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday left a trail of death and destruction in the impoverished, conflict-stricken country. The death toll from the quake jumped to more than 2,800, with a further 4,639 wounded, according to Myanmar state-run television on Wednesday. The full scale of the disaster, however, still remains unclear, and the toll is likely to rise. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. A number of countries, including India, China and Russia, have sent relief materials and teams of aid workers to assist Myanmar authorities in the rescue and relief operations. Desperate need for aid Aid agencies say there's an urgent need for water, food, shelter, medical supplies, sanitation and other services in the quake-hit areas. Myanmar humanitarian crisis deepens days after quake To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The entire town of Sagaing, near the quake's epicenter, has been devastated, said Khin Ohmar, an activist and founder of the human rights organization Progressive Voice of Myanmar. ""Sagaing, the epicenter, the city can be accessed from the Irrawaddy River from the Mandalay side, but beyond, the whole Sagaing region has been largely impacted, people have no access to aid,"" she noted. ""There are places that the media or rescue teams are still unable to access. The only aid reaching the victims and impacted communities is mostly coming from the people themselves. It's devastating."" The quake also inflicted severe damage on Naypyitaw, the country's capital and a military stronghold, where it even caused the air traffic control tower at the international airport to collapse. Aung Thu Nyein, a Myanmar political analyst, said ""there is chaos"" in the city. ""There are no rapid response teams... A national disaster management committee is organized on paper, but I see no operation like this,"" he told DW. Khin Ohmar also cast doubts about the junta's ability and inclination to deliver the aidto those in need. ""What we see is this international aid is going to be transferred either as cash or in kind into the hands of the Myanmar military,"" she said. ""Myanmar Red Cross, and Myanmar Natural Disaster Organization — two entities that are affiliated or under control of the Myanmar military — we believe they are going to be managing the international aid,"" she told DW. ""It's a grave concern. It's been five or six days and the international aid is not reaching the people."" Ongoing violence poses a challenge Access to the worst-hit areas has been hindered by not only destroyed roads and patchy telecommunications, but also continuing violence between the nation's ruling military junta and a patchwork of armed groups opposed to its rule. UN agencies and rights groups have urged all sides in the civil war to stop fighting and focus on helping those affected by the quake. The opposition National Unity Government (NUG) said anti-junta militias under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks from Sunday. The NUG includes remnants of the elected civilian government ousted by the military in a 2021 coup that triggered the civil war. Late Tuesday, an alliance of three of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic minority armed groups also announced a pause in hostilities to support the humanitarian efforts. But there have been multiple reports of military air strikes against rebel groups in recent days. Khin Ohmar said the air strikes are inhibiting local communities from helping those in need. ""In Sagaing, these strikes are severely impacting the missions and further risking the lives of impacted communities, including survivors and volunteers."" Putting regime survival over people's needs? Richard Horsey, senior adviser at the think tank Crisis Group, said delivering aid to those in need is a huge challenge in the current situation. ""There are check points and restrictions on goods going into contested areas. Those weren't set up to intercept earthquake aid, they're just still there,"" he pointed out. ""Airstrikes don't directly affect relief efforts. But they create a context in which it's clear the regime isn't willing to pause its attacks, which raises other worries in people's minds,"" he added. Years of conflict compound Myanmar quake disaster To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, D.C. who focuses on Southeast Asian politics, slammed the Myanmar military's actions. ""The military seeks to take advantage of this horrific humanitarian catastrophe,"" he told DW. ""The diplomatically isolated junta is able to garner international support. They are weaponizing aid and going to great lengths to deny humanitarian assistance from getting to regions outside of their control."" The junta, however, declared a temporary ceasefire late Wednesday. The announcement was reported on state television MRTV, which said the truce would run until April 22.

Opinion This government is determined to turn its back on sustainable forestry in Ireland MODERN IRELAND HAS never had an easy relationship with trees. Storm Éowyn, which blasted into Ireland in January with record breaking wind speeds up to 184km/hr has made matters worse. Trees were largely held responsible for the downing of power lines, leaving thousands of people without electricity or water for weeks. The toll on commercial forestry was just as bad, with the Department of Agriculture estimating that 30,000 hectares of plantation have been destroyed, valued at €500 million. Politicians were heard in the days after the storm saying that trees near roads or power lines should be torn down to ensure impacts on this scale are not repeated. However, all trees are not equal and a closer inspection would reveal that not all trees were responsible for the damage. Fast growing and non-native conifers, whether planted close to homes to act as shelter belts or in vast monocultures for commercial production, have broad and shallow root plates compared to native or broad-leaved species. Sitka spruce is particularly vulnerable to ‘wind throw’ (the forestry term for when trees are knocked over in storms) and the glut of knocked over trees is a double disaster for those who lost their forests as the price of timber going to sawmills will now be depressed. The problem with monoculture Plantations of monoculture conifers, which are grown to be clear-felled, have long been despised by environmentalists and the many communities who have to live with them. However, they can hardly be viewed more favourably by economic investors as the forestry model is vulnerable to not only extreme weather events but pests and the longer-term implications of climate change. No private investor would put their money into this type of forestry were it not for the generous offering of public subsidy. Advertisement Aerial view of a dense monoculture spruce forest in the Wicklow Mountains at the foot of the 757m peak called Kippure. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Nevertheless, even with €1.3 billion dedicated to the latest forestry programme, landowners are not biting. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, we need to be establishing 30,000 hectares (ha) of new forest every year between now and 2050 to meet ‘net zero’ climate targets. The government has set a target, however, of only 8,000ha, while in 2024, new forests only covered 4,844ha, a miserable rate of progress. The last government set about addressing issues in forestry though a collaborative forum called ‘Project Woodland’ (I was a member of it). It was to have seen a root and branch reform of the sector, clarifying and streamlining regulatory hurdles to clear the way for a new relationship with trees and forests. This would meet the needs of nature, people and the forestry industry. The new regime tightened environmental restrictions, which were badly needed to protect sensitive habitats and endangered birds such as curlews and hen harriers. It also increased the payments to landowners for establishing native forests and even included a scheme to allow for rewilding, i.e. allowing the trees to plant themselves, which is the most ecologically successful method of forest establishment. But ultimately it has fallen flat. Ireland has lost so much of its ancient forested areas, vital for biodiversity. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo The final plan envisaged that new commercial forests would be yet more conifer plantations destined to be clear-felled. The rewilding measure offered the lowest of all payments and is so restrictive that it is unlikely to be taken up. Meanwhile, the industry bemoans the new measures to protect biodiversity, citing them as the reason why planting rates are so low. The new system, in effect, pleases no one. Reform badly needed The last government had a golden opportunity to radically reform the sector. It could have said that all new commercial forests would be based upon ‘continuous cover’, i.e. diverse species with selective tree-felling that keeps the forest intact, rather than brutal clear-felling. Related Reads Opinion: The Phoenix Park deer might be part of its heritage, but they're bad for biodiversity Opinion: 'One forester said all the rules around planting native trees make him want to scream' Opinion: What's the point of a new national park if we're not preserving nature? It could have followed international best practice in prioritising rewilding through the natural regeneration of native trees. And it could have changed the mandate of state-forester Coillte, which manages half of all forests in Ireland, so that it would not be a solely for-profit entity. It had the money, the popular support, a near-unanimous Dáil motion in favour of reform and even a Green Party minister at the helm. Reforming Coillte was an action in the Programme for Government. And yet it failed to do any of these things. Kerry's Michael Healy-Rae is the new minister in charge of forestry. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo The forestry industry must surely have been popping Champagne corks with the ousting of the Green Party from government. Coillte has abandoned its ‘Coillte Nature’ wing, a popular, if modest, initiative to reverse some of the environmental damage caused by their plantations. The industry will set its hopes now on loosening of environmental regulations to allow for more plantations on peatlands or high nature value farmland, although it’s hard to see how this can be achieved given that it would need EU approval.

Aftershocks rattle earthquake-devastated Myanmar as military bombs rebel areas,"Rescuers were still pulling survivors from the rubble when one of several aftershocks struck on Sunday, sending people in Mandalay — Myanmar's second-largest city, and the epicenter of Friday's 7.7 magnitude earthquake — screaming into the streets.","Rescuers were still pulling survivors from the rubble when one of several aftershocks struck on Sunday, sending people in Mandalay — Myanmar’s second-largest city and the epicenter of Friday’s 7.7-magnitude earthquake — screaming into the streets. Already suffering the brutal toll of four years of civil war, one of the world’s poorest countries is now facing the humanitarian crisis of a powerful earthquake that has killed at least 1,600 people and counting, as aid struggles to reach those in need amid buckled roads and crumbled infrastructure. Adding to the injury, Myanmar’s ruling military junta continued to drop bombs as the civil war intersected with the natural disaster, deepening the crisis. Friday’s earthquake has incapacitated the nation’s essential services and made critical stretches of its roads impassable. Hospitals are overwhelmed and running short on medical equipment and blood. Piles of debris and severely damaged roads, including the one that runs north to Mandalay from Naypyidaw, the capital, and Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, are slowing the entry of aid into the most affected areas, according to the United Nations’ humanitarian aid office, further challenged by “telecommunications and internet disruptions.” Immediate needs include food, clothing, blankets, kitchen sets, emergency shelters, water, sanitation and hygiene supplies, the U.N. said. “Hospital and health facilities have sustained extensive damage or destruction.” As aid trickles in, residents and rescuers are digging through the debris in search of survivors. Video verified by Reuters showed Chinese rescuers working through the night in Naypyidaw. Using their hands and shovels, they dig through the wreckage of a collapsed building before pulling an elderly person, barely conscious, from the rubble. At the Sky Villa Condominium, which collapsed in Mandalay, trapping dozens of people, rescuers pulled a woman, weeping, from the debris. According to the BBC’s Burmese service, 29 people have been rescued from the complex and nine bodies recovered. “Thousands of people are spending the nights on the streets or open spaces due to the damage and destruction to home or fearing further quakes,” the U.N. said in a statement Saturday. Some countries have pitched in to help Myanmar respond to the emergency. Russia sent two planes with 120 rescuers and supplies, according to state news agency TASS, while the Chinese Embassy said on Facebook it had dispatched a 37-person team to Yangon with medicine and equipment to detect survivors. Teams from India, Singapore and Thailand are also working on the ground, according to Reuters. In neighboring Thailand, where several people have died and dozens remain missing, drones buzz over the mountain of dust and twisted rebar that was once a 30-story building, searching for signs of life. Rescue teams working on the ground said seven people were rescued alive within 24 hours of the earthquake, and that so far nobody had been rescued on Sunday. For now, the governor of Bangkok, Chadchart Sittipunt, said signs of life could still be detected in the wreckage. However, rain is threatening to slow down the rescue efforts. More than 48 hours since the building collapsed, relatives of those trapped inside are still at the site — watching and hoping that more of the missing will be found soon. On Sunday, a team of U.S. Air Force personnel arrived in Bangkok from Japan, with four men dressed partly in camouflage carrying bags of gear and a suitcase into the search zone. “We’re here to help with the rescue effort,” one of them told NBC News’ crew on the ground. But Myanmar has borne the heaviest toll from the disaster, piled onto the crises that preceded the quake. According to the International Rescue Committee, more than 19 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian aid. The World Food Programme says food insecurity in Myanmar affects 15.2 million people. Last year, the U.N. Security Council expressed concern over the “the denial of access to medicine and medical care” following attacks on health care facilities and blockades on medicines. The military regime seized power in a coup four years ago, ousting the government of the democratically elected Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Since then, the country has been gripped by civil war as the junta fights to crush armed rebel groups including the National Unity Government (NUG), Myanmar’s government in exile. On Saturday, the NUG announced a two-week pause of “offensive military operations, except for defensive actions,” in earthquake-affected areas. But the junta has not followed suit. BBC Burmese reported that seven people were killed in an airstrike in Naungcho in the northern Shan state, less than three hours after the first quake struck. Pro-democracy rebel groups fighting to remove the military from power also reported aerial bombings in Chang-U township in northwest Sagaing, near the epicenter of the quake, according to the BBC. Tom Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur for Myanmar, called for an “immediate ceasefire” and a suspension of military conscription. “Aid workers should not have to fear arrest and there should be no obstructions to aid getting to where it is most needed,” he said Sunday on X. “Every second counts.” For now, bombs continue to fall on a country that is still counting its dead.

Originally designed as a ruggedized towable pickup bed for hauling heavy, jagged cargo across equally jagged off-road surfaces, LGA's trailer now transforms into a pull-behind pop-top pickup camper of the simplest form. It's an affordable, hassle-free and versatile way to travel and camp your way through the wild. The Crashpad isn't so much a trailer model as it is an upfit kit for LGA's LittleGiant and SpecOps cargo trailers. The LittleGiant trailer was introduced in 2008 as a simple, versatile utility trailer inspired by a pickup bed. It's evolved some over the years, and the contemporary version features a U-shaped tub body made from powder-coated galvanized steel. Its removable front and rear walls make it even more versatile than a pickup bed for carrying cargo that outsizes its 7.2-ft (2.2-m) bed length – things like lumber or paddleboards. The walls can then be reinstalled whenever a proper boxed bed is needed. A 3/4-ton trailer, the LittleGiant offers 1,500 lb (680 kg) of payload on what LGA calls an all-terrain platform. The 1-ton SpecOps steps up as a heavier duty overland version of the same trailer with an upgraded torsion axle, larger wheels and mud-terrain tires for a full 2,000 lb (907 kg) of drag-anywhere payload. The SpecOps also offers 5 more inches (13 cm) of ground clearance for 20 inches (51 cm). Both trailers have the same 86 x 54 x 24-in (218 x 137 x 61-cm) box measurements and removable tailgate and front gate. Against a backdrop of pandemic-accelerated interest in camping and road trips, LGA added the Crashpad to the LittleGiant/SpecOps accessory family in 2021. Simpler than the company's Treehaus or Summithaus trailer tent camper systems, the Crashpad offers the advantage of putting a hard roof over your head that then doubles as a lockable hard cover for protecting the gear inside the trailer. That hard roof is LGA's Hexcap, a strut-assisted tonneau cover made from UV-resistant polypropylene composite. It's covered wagon-like dome shape isn't done merely for 19th century vibes but as a way of increasing overall cargo capacity above the trailer's sidewall. In the same way, it increases interior headroom when camping. The cover also adds cargo security via lockable latches (locks sold separately) and is available as an accessory on its own as well as with the Crashpad package. Creating a camper out of a HexCapped trailer was as simple as connecting the cap and trailer with sidewall fabric and a zippered back door. That waterproof-coated 185D Cordura fabric installs and removes via heavy-duty Velcro, without a single tool. The design includes two side windows and an entry door screen for plenty of ventilation. The window and door screens include zippered weatherproof fabric shades, and an above-entry awning provides further protection from rain, sun and weather. Viewing the Crashpad from the outside, we initially assumed campers would simply sleep atop the tub floor. However, LGA has a more elegant, versatile solution, adding a folding polypropylene platform to the build so that campers sleep above the floor. The fold-out platform is supported by five steel beams that attach into the standard C-channel rails that run the length of the trailer atop the sidewalls. The platform measures 75 x 54 in (191 x 137 cm) and sleeps two, offering 48 inches (122 cm) of headroom at the front where the sloped roof is highest. LGA does not include a mattress, but it would be easy enough to bring your own inflatable or foam mattress. In fact, those dimensions are identical to a full-size bed, so campers can opt for a full-size mattress to cover the whole platform or single sleeping pads/bags for each person. Beyond giving campers a better bed option than a dusty, banged-up cargo trailer tub, the platform ensures they don't have to unload all their gear when sleeping inside – the gear can remain on the floor 21 inches (53 cm) below the sleeping platform. The platform can also double as a cargo shelf for organizing gear when traveling, offering 24 inches (61 cm) of height to the peak of the tonneau arch. For those who don't want a shelf during transit, the sleeping platform folds down to a 75 x 18 x 2-in (191 x 46 x 5-cm) form that packs easily on the trailer floor or against the sidewall. One final platform advantage – campers can keep the trailer floor empty as a space for pets to sleep. Let's Go Aero upgrades the tailgate for the Crashpad package with a set of hinges and support cables that turns it into a sturdy truck-style tailgate. It can serve as a cooking table, outdoor shelf or bench seat and even includes a foam pad insert for use as a seat. The tailgate can also remove from the rear-end and attach to either side of the trailer to serve as a side table – this way, no one has to step over the kitchen when getting in and out of the interior. Simple design means simple setup. LGA has essentially created a pop-up wedge tent on wheels. Setup will take slightly longer than just popping a rooftop tent since some of the Velcro needs to be secured, the sleeping platform might need to be set up, and the awning might need guying out, but it need only take a few minutes to go from towing to lying down in bed. The entire Crashpad package with Hexcap tonneau cover adds 110 lb (50 kg) to the weight of the base trailer, bringing total weight to 590 lb (268 kg) for the 10-foot-long (3-m) LittleGiant and 670 lb (304 kg) for the 10-ft SpecOps. All in all, the Crashpad seems like a slick little solution for doubling up the utility of an already versatile cargo trailer. Beyond serving as a primary shelter, it also seems like a natural fit for hauling gear that won't fit in the main camper van, motorhome or truck camper, then working as an extra bedroom for children or guests. The LittleGiant Crashpad is available for a price of US$6,998, while the SpecOps overland Crashpad goes for $8,198. LGA also offers the Crashpad as an upfit kit for existing LittleGiant and SpecOps owners, so if you already own the trailer or want a simple cargo hauler with the option of adding a camper setup later, you have that ability. That kit costs $2,999 with the Hexcap or $1,499 for those who already have the Hexcap. All of the hardware, including the bolt-together trailers themselves, ships as a kit and requires user assembly.

"All items required in a '72-hour survival kit' as 450,000,000 people warned to prepare due to rising tensions",The European Union has called for everyone to have their survival kit ready 'to prevent and respond to emerging threats',"To make sure you never miss out on your favourite NEW stories, we're happy to send you some reminders Click 'OK' then 'Allow' to enable notifications The European Union has urged households to get their '72-hour survival kits' ready due to the various 'challenges that cannot be ignored'. 450,000,000 people who live in the EU have been told to make sure they have all their essentials ready if 'disaster hits'. Their 'preparedness strategy' has come about 'from growing geopolitical tensions and conflicts, hybrid and cybersecurity threats' and issues ranging from 'climate change' to the 'increase in natural disasters'. Advert President Ursula von der Leyen said 'our citizens, our Member States, and our businesses need the right tools to act both to prevent crises and to react swiftly when a disaster hits'. She used the example of 'families living in flood zones' who 'should know what to do when the waters rise'. The President also noted that 'early warning systems can prevent regions hit by wildfires from losing precious time'. The official website for the City of Calgary in Canada has shared what items you need to include in a 72-hour kit. All items required in a '72 hour survival kit' Bottled water Advert Above all, you need four litres of water per person, per day. ""Ideally, you should replace the water bottles every time you change your clocks. If necessary, you can use the water in your toilet tank or hot water heater,"" they state. Although humans can generally survive about three days without water, staying hydrated is crucial. Food Advert If you're storing emergency food supplies, you obviously need to make sure to check food expiry dates, and stick to canned food. Don't forget to keep a manual can opener. Medication Be sure to include any prescription medication that you or your family members take on a regular basis. ""Ideally, you should swap the medication out regularly for fresh medication. If you cannot store extra medication in your kit, make sure you take it with you in an evacuation. You may also want to include vitamins and medications to guard you against getting sick,"" the website states. First aid kit Advert A first aid kit 'should be easily accessible in your home and vehicle' and usually consists of the following items: • gloves • gauze pads • a variety of bandages • antiseptic Advert • scissors • tweezers • needle and thread • instant ice packs • survival blanket, if space allows External battery pack or wind-up phone charger The most important item on the list, for many of us, is something that can charge your smartphone. We've become so reliant on our phones these days and not being able to update your Instagram Story during a crisis would be the real tragedy. ""It is important that you are able to use your cell phone to call for help or to receive information. If phone lines are too busy, you can still receive updates and alerts on your mobile device,"" the website adds. Cash in small bills and coins It's always handy to keep a bit of spare cash around if the digital banking system were to ever go down, or if the power is out. Of course, not everyone has the luxury of saving money they don't have in a cost-of-living crisis. But if there are any coin-operated facilities about, it's worth keeping a few pennies on you. Important documents Obviously it's not very practical to keep all your important documents locked away in a bag. But consider printing photocopies and including them in your 72 hour kit. Be sure to review your documents periodically to make sure they're up to date. Other items: • non-power consuming entertainment likes board games, cards or books • supplies for your baby and pet • warm clothes, blankets and sleeping bags • personal sanitation items, such as hand sanitiser, masks, and wet wipes • a whistle to help attract attention if needed • dust mask and dusk tape to help keep your shelter in place How do I store my supplies? The website states that 'supplies should be stored in a waterproof, wheeled suitcase or container'. ""Your kit must be portable in case you have to evacuate your home. If you have luggage, bag your supplies and store them in your luggage when you are not travelling. You can remove the bags for travel,"" it adds. ""Store medications, cash, and important documents in an external pouch for easy access. Your First Aid kit and water supply should also be immediately accessible. ""Make sure that you check your kit and replenish/swap supplies as needed. An easy way to remember is to check your kit when you change your clocks.""

Read full story","Humanitarian operation in Myanmar hindered by damaged roads and infrastructure, says UN agency Sunday, 30 Mar 2025 A view shows debris after a strong earthquake struck central Myanmar, in Mandalay, Myanmar, March 29, 2025. REUTERS/Stringer GENEVA (Reuters) -Humanitarian operations in Myanmar have been hindered by damaged roads and infrastructure, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Saturday. A 7.7 magnitude earthquake on Friday severely damaged critical infrastructure including major bridges and roads, making it difficult for humanitarian operations to access areas in need, OCHA said. ""Damage to the Yangon-Nay Pyi Taw-Mandalay expressway led to service disruptions, with cracks and surface distortions forcing highway buses to halt operations"", the UN agency said in a statement. Hospitals in central and northwestern Myanmar are struggling to cope with the influx of people injured in the earthquake, the agency stated. Seventeen cargo trucks of shelter and medical supplies are due to arrive on March 30, to address current shortages of medicines including blood bags and anaesthetics. Myanmar's military rulers let in hundreds of foreign rescue personnel on Saturday after the earthquake killed more than 1,600 people, the deadliest natural disaster to hit the impoverished, war-torn country in years. Friday's quake, among the biggest to jolt the Southeast Asian nation in the last century, crippled airports, bridges and highways amid a civil war that has wrecked the economy and displaced millions.

The layout you choose today will influence your daily life for many years. A well-chosen house plan can make your living spaces more functional, comfortable, and aligned with your family’s needs. From modern open concepts to cozy country designs, your home’s blueprint sets the stage for everything that follows. This practical guide helps you sort through options, understand important features, and select a house plan that works for your lifestyle, location, and budget. Don’t settle for a standard design that almost fits—find or modify plans that truly reflect how you want to live. Start your search today with these helpful tips. Modern Luxury House Designs to Consider When choosing the right style for your home, it’s important to think about how each option aligns with your lifestyle and preferences. Each style offers unique features that cater to different needs, from spacious layouts to cozy, intimate spaces. 1. Modern House Plans Modern house plans emphasize minimalism and functionality in their design approach. These homes feature expansive windows that fill rooms with natural light, creating bright, airy spaces throughout. The open-concept layout removes unnecessary walls, allowing for flexible living areas that can adapt to various needs. Construction materials often include concrete, steel, and glass, giving these homes their distinctive contemporary look. The flat or low-pitched roofs create clean horizontal lines that complement the overall design. Color schemes typically remain neutral with whites, grays, and blacks, occasionally accented with bold color touches. Modern homes prioritize energy efficiency through strategic window placement and sustainable building materials. Interior spaces often include built-in storage solutions that maintain the clean, uncluttered style. These designs appeal to those who value simplicity, sustainability, and practical living arrangements. 2. Mediterranean & Coastal House Plans Mediterranean and coastal house plans capture the essence of seaside living with their distinct architectural elements. These designs showcase stucco exterior walls in warm, sun-washed colors that resist heat and stand up to coastal conditions. The signature clay tile roofs not only complete the visual style but also provide excellent insulation properties. Arched doorways and windows create graceful transitions between spaces while allowing sea breezes to circulate. Interior spaces feature cool tile or stone flooring that feels pleasant underfoot during warm weather. Courtyards and outdoor living areas form essential components of these homes, creating private outdoor sanctuaries. The floor plans typically flow naturally from room to room, making the homes feel spacious and connected. Wrought iron details on stairways, light fixtures, and railings add authentic character to these designs. These homes work especially well in sunny locations where outdoor living is possible year-round. 3. Country & Cottage House Plans Country and cottage house plans focus on comfort and practical living spaces that feel warm and inviting. These designs typically feature modest footprints with smart space utilization throughout. The pitched roofs often include dormers that add character while creating useful attic spaces. Exterior details might include stone accents, shutters, and covered porches that enhance curb appeal. Kitchens serve as central gathering spaces with practical layouts that emphasize function over formality. Built-in breakfast nooks or window seats create cozy spots for morning coffee or casual meals. Interior details often include exposed wood beams, wainscoting, and built-in cabinets that add character without requiring extensive space. These homes typically include mudrooms or utility spaces that help maintain organization in daily family life. The overall layout creates a sense of shelter and security, with rooms sized for comfort rather than show. These designs appeal to those who value tradition, comfort, and practical living solutions. 4. Other Styles Various additional home styles offer unique characteristics that suit different locations and personal preferences. Rustic designs incorporate natural materials like logs and stone, creating solid structures with a strong connection to natural surroundings. Spanish Colonial homes feature thick walls, internal courtyards, and terra cotta details that work well in hot climates. Craftsman styles showcase handcrafted details, built-in furniture, and natural materials that create homes with exceptional character and quality. Tuscan designs blend farmhouse practicality with sophisticated Italian influences, resulting in homes that feel both casual and refined. Each style has specific roof treatments, window styles, and exterior finishes that create its distinctive look. Interior layouts vary based on the historical origins and practical considerations of each design tradition. Regional variations exist within each style category, allowing for customization based on local conditions and building practices. These diverse options give homeowners many ways to express their personal style while meeting their functional needs. Special Features to Look for in a House Plan When choosing a house plan, it’s essential to focus on features that enhance both functionality and comfort. Look for plans that offer spacious living areas, convenient layouts, and unique features like ample storage or a functional home office. These elements can significantly improve your day-to-day living experience. 1. Functional Features Consider adding useful features that make your daily home life simpler. These practical additions help your space work better for you and can make everyday tasks easier. When looking at house plans, focus on these helpful elements that fit your family’s needs and daily routines. 2. Sustainability and Energy Efficiency Consider adding a passive solar design to your home plan to use the sun’s natural heat and light. Energy-saving appliances reduce electricity and water usage while maintaining good performance. Sustainable building materials from renewable or recycled sources are better for the planet. These green choices lead to lower utility bills and reduce your home’s environmental impact. 3. Outdoor Living Spaces When reviewing plan options, pay attention to designs that include patios and balconies. Many excellent plans also feature outdoor kitchens or cozy fireplaces. A good link between indoor and outdoor areas makes a home feel bigger and more open. These spaces give you a place to relax and spend time with family while enjoying fresh air and sunshine. Plants and natural surroundings add to the calm feeling these spaces can create. A cup of coffee on your patio in the morning or dinner on the deck in the evening can become a special part of your daily life. How to Choose the Right House Plan for Your Lifestyle Each house style brings unique features and benefits to suit various preferences and living situations. The right plan can create a perfect fit for your lifestyle and future needs, from open-concept layouts to cozy, functional spaces. Customizing Your House Plan Customizing your house plan allows you to make sure every detail fits your needs and lifestyle. You can adjust the layout or add new features to create a home that perfectly suits you. Plan Modification Services You can change most existing plans to better fit what you want. This might mean adding or removing rooms, changing layouts, or increasing room sizes. Working with a designer can help make sure the changes work well with the overall design. Custom House Plans If you want something totally your own, you can ask for a fully custom plan. How to Customize a Plan: A Step-by-Step Guide Modifying existing house plans allows for personalization while keeping costs lower than creating a completely new design. Working with a professional designer or home builder can help turn your ideas into practical changes that maintain structural integrity. Step 1. Choosing the Right Base Plan Begin with a plan that closely resembles your vision. Making adjustments to an existing design is more cost-effective than creating an entirely new blueprint. Select plans with the basic elements you want, focusing on overall layout and square footage that align with your needs. Check the home’s orientation, window placement, and general flow. Take note of plans that have received positive feedback from others who have built them, as this often indicates good functionality. Compare multiple options before making your final selection for your custom project. 2. Modifying the Layout You can expand your living space by adding rooms based on your specific requirements. Think about what functions you need that aren’t in the original plan, such as a home office, media room, or additional bathroom. Consider how these additions will connect with existing spaces and affect traffic patterns. Adjusting room dimensions lets you redistribute square footage to areas that matter most for your lifestyle—perhaps a more spacious kitchen while reducing the dining area slightly. Think about ceiling heights as well; raising ceilings in main living areas can create an open feeling without increasing the home’s footprint. Changing the internal arrangement can improve how you move through the house. This includes repositioning doorways, altering hallway configurations, or rethinking how connected spaces relate to each other. Small adjustments often make significant differences in daily usability. You might want to remove walls to create open-concept areas or add separations for more privacy, depending on your preferences. 3. Working with a Designer A professional designer brings valuable expertise to your modification project. They can translate your ideas into practical changes while maintaining the home’s structural soundness. Designers spot potential issues before construction begins and offer creative solutions that you might not have considered. They understand how to balance aesthetics with functionality and can suggest materials and finishes that complement your modified plan. Designers also create detailed drawings that contractors can follow accurately, reducing errors during construction. Their knowledge of current trends and long-lasting features helps ensure your modified home remains appealing for years to come. 4. Understanding Modification Costs Basic alterations to a standard plan differ in expense from substantial structural changes. The final investment depends on the extent of electrical and plumbing system adjustments needed. Ask for detailed estimates that break down each modification to avoid surprises. Some modifications contribute more to the home than others—kitchen and bathroom updates typically offer good returns. Think about the long-term implications, too; larger rooms mean more heating and cooling expenses. Ask about energy-efficient alternatives that might require more initial investment but provide savings over time. Keep in mind that complex roof changes often increase the overall project scope significantly. 5. Considering Structural Requirements All modifications must comply with local building regulations. Walls that support weight above require special consideration when altered or removed. Foundation changes might be necessary to support additions, which can significantly affect your project. For significant changes, a structural engineer’s assessment might be necessary for your project. This review helps ensure your home’s long-term stability and safety. Think about how modifications might affect the home’s resistance to local weather conditions, such as high winds or heavy snow loads. Some regions have specific requirements for earthquake or hurricane resistance that must be included in your modifications. 6. Getting Builder Input Contact your builder early when planning modifications. Their hands-on construction knowledge helps identify which changes make sense and which might create complications during building. Builders can recommend alternative approaches that achieve your goals while minimizing complications during the build phase. They understand local material availability, which can help with your choices. Builders can also point out potential maintenance issues with certain design selections. Their input on site-specific considerations like soil conditions, drainage requirements, and lot positioning can be very helpful. A good builder will help you create a balance between your wish list and what’s actually feasible to create a home that meets your needs without unnecessary complications. Modern Luxury House Design Pricing Modern luxury house design pricing typically ranges from $1,500 to $8,000, depending on complexity and included features. Basic sets providing just blueprints and building instructions start around $1,500, while comprehensive packages with detailed specifications cost $3,000-$8,000. Quality plans include material specifications and structural components, helping contractors provide accurate estimates. 3D renderings, which add $500-$1,000 to the cost, allow visualization of your space from multiple angles. Design firms offer tiered pricing options to fit various budgets. This initial investment in professional plans reduces overall project costs by minimizing construction confusion and preventing costly delays. Resources for Home Builders Construction professionals can access various tools such as digital plan libraries, cost estimation software, material suppliers, and local building code information. These resources help streamline projects and maintain quality standards throughout the building process. Finding the Right Builder Take time to find a builder who understands your vision. Ask for references and look at their past work. Some plan services have builder programs that can make the process smoother. Meeting with multiple construction professionals allows you to compare quotes and approaches. Consider professionals who specialize in your specific style of home for better results. Communication is key—establish clear expectations about timelines and budget constraints early in your discussions with potential builders. Building Resources and Tools Use resources like: Many house plan websites offer tools to help you plan your building project. Budget tracking applications can assist in monitoring expenses throughout construction. Local building supply retailers often provide material estimates based on your plans. Online forums for homeowners going through similar projects can offer valuable insights and recommendations. Industry magazines feature articles on current construction methods and material options. Contract templates and checklists help ensure all important details are addressed before breaking ground. Scheduling software keeps all parties informed about project progress and upcoming phases. Conclusion Finding the perfect house plan requires careful consideration but pays off in the long run. By focusing on your specific needs, design preferences, and financial limits, you can select a plan that transforms into a living space you’ll enjoy for many years to come. Look through various plan collections, inquire about modification options, and reach out to design experts who can guide you through the process. The right professionals will help you balance your vision with practical considerations. Remember that a well-chosen house plan serves as the foundation for your future home. Taking time now to make informed decisions will lead to a residential space that truly meets your requirements and reflects your personal style for decades to come.

Once Lush Sahara Was Home to a Surprisingly Unique Group of Humans,"Currently a harsh, arid sandscape, it's hard to believe the Sahara was once studded with sparkling water bodies that nourished lush green savannas.","Once Lush Sahara Was Home to a Surprisingly Unique Group of Humans Currently a harsh, arid sandscape, it's hard to believe the Sahara was once studded with sparkling water bodies that nourished lush green savannas. But the remains of human pastoralists and their livestock have been found in the region's rock shelters. A new genetic analysis suggests the humans who called this 7,000-year-old version of the Sahara home largely kept to themselves, genetically speaking. Max Planck Institute evolutionary anthropologist Nada Salem and colleagues sequenced the ancient DNA of two female individuals buried at the Takarkori rock shelter in what's now southwestern Libya. The 7,000-year-old Takarkori women shared the most genes with 15,000-year-old foragers from Morocco, suggesting a long-standing, stable human population existed in North Africa before and during the Saharan humid period. ""Evidence from ancient lake deposits, pollen samples, and archaeological artifacts confirm human presence, hunting, herding, and resource gathering in the currently arid desert region,"" Salem and team explain in their paper. This shared Saharan human lineage took a different path from those in sub-Saharan Africa around the same time that modern humans first left the continent more than 50,000 years ago. The lineage then remained relatively isolated for many thousands of years, with only small traces of genes entering from the Levantine region to the northeast – including some from Neanderthals. ""Our findings suggest that while early North African populations were largely isolated, they received traces of Neanderthal DNA due to gene flow from outside Africa,"" says anthropologist Johannes Krause, from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. The Takarkori individuals had less Neanderthal DNA than the Moroccan foragers, but significantly more than those from further south of Africa. That suggests that something stemmed the gene flow from Europe from spreading beyond the Sahara region. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Takarkori people were early herders of livestock, unlike the older Moroccan lineages who were foragers. That they picked up this practice without much gene exchange is also telling. ""This discovery reveals how pastoralism spread across the Green Sahara, likely through cultural exchange rather than large-scale migration,"" Salem explains. The diverse mix of ecosystems, including wetlands and mountains, may have provided a southern barrier for migration, the researchers suspect. ""By shedding light on the Sahara's deep past, we aim to increase our knowledge of human migrations, adaptations, and cultural evolution in this key region,"" concludes Sapienza University archeologist Savino di Lernia.

Getting Abundance Right The abundance agenda, which has gained traction in media and policy circles, offers little beyond what has already been tried and failed. Rather than doubling down on neoliberal dogma, Americans should look to a time in their history when a bold, capable federal government delivered broad-based economic prosperity. WASHINGTON, DC – From Elon Musk to proponents of the so-called abundance agenda, influential voices in the United States portray the state as an impediment to prosperity. Musk asserts that the state traps workers in low-productivity jobs, while the abundance agenda’s promoters attack environmental review and zoning rules as bureaucratic obstacles to private investment. The common theme is a state that prevents the emergence of an American golden age defined by plentiful clean energy and affordable housing. The abundance agenda has been gaining traction in media and policy circles, not least because it offers an explanation for inadequate investment in zero-carbon energy and housing. But it is a flawed approach that ignores the benefits of government intervention. For example, zoning can separate industrial activities from residential areas and ensure that new homes are supported by adequate physical and social infrastructure. Fundamentally, the abundance agenda dismisses the value of public input. Giving communities a say in infrastructure development can lead to more informed land-use decisions and serve as a democratic check on powerful corporate interests. Instead of being jettisoned, environmental review and zoning should be improved through tailored measures, such as expanding state administrative capacity and directing greater population density toward places with ample health-care, school, and transit capacity. More broadly, the abundance agenda embodies the failure to confront the pathologies of contemporary capitalism. Simply granting corporations the legal freedom to build by relaxing zoning rules and environmental reviews ignores the fact that today’s corporations place short-term shareholder payouts above long-term objectives and are thus unlikely to invest at the scale and scope necessary to deliver broad-based abundance. The most effective rebuttal to this anti-statist philosophy is the American experience itself. US economic history includes episodes in which vigorous government action proved crucial for prosperity. A prime example is President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, which delivered shared abundance by expanding public capacity – most notably through large-scale investments in electricity infrastructure. These investments made electricity affordable and widely available, and pushed the private sector to expand access and lower costs. Whereas private companies refused to extend power lines into the countryside – leaving millions of rural Americans in the dark – the New Deal brought electricity to nearly every corner of the country. Though less radical on housing, Congress in the 1930s also expanded the housing supply and improved the quality and livability of homes. If Americans are truly committed to achieving broadly shared abundance, they shouldn’t fall for warmed-over neoliberal dogma repackaged for the twenty-first century. Instead, they should look to a time in their own history when a bold, capable federal government stepped in to deliver real prosperity for the many, not just the few. FDR’s “Birch Rod” A century ago, the provision of electricity was a major political issue. The absence of electricity was a defining feature of rural life – in 1930, fewer than one in ten farmers had access to power. While most urban households were connected to the grid, only the wealthy could afford heavy-duty items like refrigerators and washing machines, as high electricity rates, prohibitive appliance prices, and a housing stock ill-equipped for modern living kept these technologies out of reach for most people. Private power companies showed little interest in serving the mass residential market. Instead, they focused on wealthy households and, above all, industrial clients.

Subscribe Now Recognizing the stakes, Roosevelt outlined his vision for the power sector during a 1932 campaign stop in Portland, Oregon. While affirming his belief that private ownership should remain the industry norm, he also called for stronger public oversight of privately owned utilities. Regulatory commissions, he argued, should act as advocates for the public interest rather than as neutral arbiters adjudicating disputes between utilities and their customers. He delved into the technical side of public utility regulation as well, reviewing the common-carriage rules that governed ferries and inns and endorsing simpler and more objective methods for valuing utility systems. In the more radical portion of his speech, Roosevelt called for a major expansion of federal and public involvement in the power sector. He envisioned federal hydroelectric projects on the Columbia, Colorado, St. Lawrence, and Tennessee Rivers. Some, like the dams on the Colorado and Tennessee, were already completed or under construction. Roosevelt described such projects as “yardsticks” by which to measure the performance of private power companies. Through direct competition and public pressure, they would help keep private utility rates in check. Roosevelt extended the yardstick concept to local distribution. A public utility in one town, he suggested, could discipline the rates of a neighboring town’s private provider simply through comparison. Publicity, in his telling, would help regulate the rates and service of private utilities. But Roosevelt also acknowledged that publicity alone would not be enough. Some private utilities might remain impervious to naming and shaming, as well as to unflattering comparisons with public alternatives. In such cases, he said, local communities should be able to take over private utilities and operate them as public entities. Roosevelt illustrated his argument with a metaphor that would no longer pass political muster: “I might call the right of the people to own and operate their own utility something like this: a ‘birch rod’ in the cupboard to be taken out and used only when the ‘child’ gets beyond the point where a mere scolding does no good.” Following Roosevelt’s inauguration in March 1933, Congress moved quickly to implement the vision he laid out six months earlier. In the first 100 days of his presidency, lawmakers created the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to build dams on the Tennessee River and its tributaries and serve as a regional development agency. The Roosevelt administration also allocated recovery funds to dam construction across the country. In the Pacific Northwest, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation began building the Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams, respectively, on the Columbia River. While the New Dealers – to their discredit – discounted the interests of indigenous peoples and tenant farmers in their dam-building efforts, they did plan extensively. Rather than developing water resources in an ad hoc manner, federal agencies drew on years of surveying by the Army Corps of Engineers and sought to construct dams in a way that maximized the hydroelectric output of the Columbia and Tennessee River basins. The federal government also supported the creation of community-owned electric-distribution utilities. The Public Works Administration (PWA) – established by Congress to fund state and local construction projects and put Americans back to work – played a key role in bringing Roosevelt’s “birch rod” principle to life. Although the PWA did not directly finance the buyouts of existing private utilities, it offered low-cost loans and grants to cities seeking to build their own competing power systems. These funds enabled cities and towns to threaten private power companies with public competition, bringing them to the bargaining table to negotiate buyouts in good faith. After some delay, the federal government turned its attention to rural electrification. In 1935, Roosevelt issued an executive order establishing the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) to fund the construction of power lines in underserved rural areas. Congress made the agency permanent in 1936 and directed it to give preference to cooperatives and public power agencies when allocating credit. The surge in public investment was accompanied by public regulation of private utilities. In the mid-1930s, private holding companies dominated the industry, in many cases owning far-flung utility systems that lacked any real coherence. Economist James Bonbright described these holding companies as a “helter-skelter formation of systems of poorly integrated properties in defiance of all principles of engineering technique and operating efficiency.” But while these corporate structures provided little social value, they generated easy profits for their executives and investors, who could control vast utility empires with relatively small outlays. In response, Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The law – the product of an intense six-month legislative battle – aimed to break up utility company empires that failed to serve the public interest. No Yardsticks for Housing By contrast, Congress took a far more conservative approach to housing. The federal government’s most significant intervention was the establishment of a national mortgage market, achieved by insuring home loans against default – provided those loans met specific criteria. Backing only mortgages for properties that adhered to certain size and design standards, the Federal Housing Administration increased both the volume of home construction and the overall quality of America’s housing stock. This system worked symbiotically with private homebuilders. By supporting the extension of low-cost, long-term credit – most notably, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage – the federal government dramatically widened the pool of financing available to prospective homeowners, albeit primarily for white Americans. The federal government also funded the construction of rental housing by local governments, though this effort looked radically different from Roosevelt’s more ambitious electricity policy. While the PWA built high-quality housing for a broader segment of the population, that experiment was short-lived. Under the Housing Act of 1937, federal support was directed toward rental housing for the middle class “submerged” by the Great Depression and the working poor. The affluent remained the exclusive domain of private developers and landlords. The 1937 Act included another major limitation that was fundamentally at odds with the yardstick concept that guided New Deal policy in the power sector. To avoid expanding the national housing supply and competing with private real-estate interests, Congress inserted the “equivalent elimination” clause: for every new unit of public housing built, an existing home had to be removed eventually from the market. While the federal government was massively expanding the country’s power-generation capacity through institutions like the TVA, it imposed artificial limits on its public housing programs. What the New Deal Got Right The New Deal transformed everyday life in America, making electricity both universal and affordable. By working with rural residents to set up electricity cooperatives and build power lines, the federal government helped electrify the countryside. In cities, working and middle-class households, many of whom already had electricity before the New Deal, benefited from rate reductions and increased their consumption. Combined with a modernized housing stock and more affordable appliances – also a result of federal action – millions of Americans now had refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines in their homes. Congress and the Roosevelt administration had successfully implemented the yardstick principle. Federal dams produced large volumes of low-cost hydroelectric power, and public competition – paired with stronger regulation – reoriented private utilities away from short-term profit maximization toward delivering reliable service at reasonable prices, reducing rates across the board. The power of public competition was undeniable. As historian Thomas McCraw observed in 1976, private power rates were consistently lower in areas closer to the Columbia and Tennessee Rivers, the two hubs of federal power generation. Meanwhile, the success of the REA-led rural electrification program proved to private utilities that the rural market – which they had long written off – was, in fact, a lucrative one. Tupelo, Mississippi, was one of the first places to benefit from abundant, federally generated electricity. Connected to the TVA system in 1934, the city gained access to electricity at significantly lower wholesale rates than those offered by private utilities. The TVA directed the municipally owned utility to pass those savings on to customers, and the results were immediate: in one of the poorest parts of the country, average household power consumption more than doubled between 1934 and 1935, as Tupelo residents were suddenly able to enjoy modern comforts such as refrigerators and washing machines. When Roosevelt visited the city in November 1934, he highlighted the qualitative improvement in living standards: “[T]he number of new refrigerators that have been put in, for example, means something besides just plain dollars and cents. It means a greater human happiness. The introduction of electric cookstoves and all the other dozens of things which, when I was in the Navy, we used to call ‘gadgets,’ is improving human life.” The practical benefits of electricity were felt most acutely by women, especially in rural areas. Bringing electricity into the home relieved women of the backbreaking, time-consuming labor of doing laundry by hand. Yet, despite the significant expansion of federal and local participation in electricity generation and distribution, private power companies continued to dominate the sector. In 1947 – nearly 15 years after the onset of New Deal reforms – private utilities still served more than three-quarters of American consumers and generated around 80% of the country’s electricity. As Roosevelt intended, private ownership remained the norm. More ambitious efforts by more progressive members of the public power coalition, such as Republican Senator George Norris, fell short. Norris’s vision of establishing “little TVAs” and a network of federal power yardsticks across the country met strong resistance in Congress and ultimately lost the support of Roosevelt, whose appetite for continued reform had cooled by the late 1930s. Yardsticks for the Twenty-First Century Public yardsticks can play a vital role in addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time, especially climate change and the housing crisis. Both require swift, large-scale action, and the public sector is well-positioned to expand the supply of clean energy and affordable housing while also pushing private companies to raise their standards. The “little TVAs” model championed by progressives in the 1930s and 1940s offers a valuable blueprint for accelerating decarbonization. Although renewable-energy output has grown significantly over the past two decades, the current pace remains too slow to meet critical climate targets. The US still generates roughly 60% of its electricity from natural gas and coal. A publicly owned renewable-energy developer – free of shareholder pressure for dividends and stock buybacks, and with access to lower-cost financing – could invest more aggressively in solar, wind, and other renewables. Given the ongoing destruction of state capacity – including at power agencies like the Bonneville Power Administration – by US President Donald Trump’s administration, meaningful federal intervention is unlikely anytime soon. But state and locally owned utilities, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, can still move forward with decarbonization efforts on their own. New York is already moving in this direction. In 2023, the state legislature empowered the publicly owned New York Power Authority – originally established by then-Governor Roosevelt in 1931 – to develop large-scale renewable energy projects. Under an implementation plan announced in January, the NYPA proposed building three gigawatts of renewable-energy capacity. But the NYPA can and should go much further to meet the state’s ambitious climate goals, especially given the repeated failure of private-sector projects. Similarly, state and local housing authorities can help expand the housing supply while imposing competitive pressure on private landlords. Rather than simply lifting zoning restrictions and other public barriers and then hoping that private developers will find large-scale construction sufficiently profitable in the near and medium term, state agencies can take a hands-on approach by building and managing housing units for poor, working-class, and middle-class households. By competing with private developers and landlords, these agencies would not only increase the overall housing supply but also help regulate rents and improve habitability standards. Well-managed public housing agencies could exert competitive pressure on their private counterparts, delivering meaningful benefits to tenants across the market. Maryland’s Montgomery County, where the public housing authority is actively building rental units aimed at working- and middle-class households, offers a useful model. This approach differs significantly from the prevailing model of public housing. While cities like New York and Chicago own and operate residential rental properties, their public housing authorities are not true yardsticks because they typically do not compete directly with private actors. Originally designed in the 1930s, they function as housing of last resort, providing shelter to individuals and families lacking the means to rent from private landlords or purchase a home. Their housing stock, intentionally built to be lower quality than private alternatives, was meant to supplement rather than challenge private landlords. Today, after decades of neoliberal law and policy, the gap between corporate incentives and the public good is wider than ever. Given that companies routinely prioritize stock buybacks, dividends, and mergers over investment in productive capacity and long-term capabilities, the Abundance movement’s call to give them more freedom to build is unlikely to deliver meaningful benefits without a deeper transformation of American capitalism. More importantly, the US already has a proven track record of producing abundance through public investment and regulation. By directly providing essential goods and services, whether energy, housing, or broadband, the government can expand supply and compel the private sector to be more socially responsive, harnessing the power of competition and public accountability. Instead of doubling down on the failures of the past half-century, we should revisit a model that has already proven to be highly effective at promoting abundance and strengthening democratic institutions.

Kyodo/via REUTERS/File Photo (Reuters) - On Thursday night, Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing stood astride a jeep, touring columns of saluting soldiers as fighter jets shot flares and helicopters buzzed overhead in an annual display of military might in the capital, Naypyitaw. The general was riding high, set to join a regional leaders’ summit in Thailand this week, a rare overseas trip four years after seizing power in a coup that ushered in a ruinous civil war and made him an international pariah. But within 24 hours, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake had reduced parts of Naypyitaw to ruins, dealing a major blow to the home of Myanmar military power in the purpose-built, isolated capital whose Burmese name means ""Abode of Kings"". Without electricity, water or internet, junta officials are working from the lawns beside the ruins of the foreign ministry while residents sleep on the street for fear of aftershocks. The quake – Myanmar's strongest in a century – has killed around 2,000 people and dealt widespread devastation including in Naypyitaw, a city unveiled in 2005 after being secretly built by previously ruling generals who wanted an impregnable fortress. The city was built to evoke the grandeur of ancient Buddhist architecture and former royalty, with wide manicured boulevards including a little-used 20-lane highway and monumental government buildings with colonnades. It had stood mostly protected from the chaos of civil war that has rocked other parts of the country since the coup: a rare drone attack last year was foiled. Satellite images and photos published by local media show collapsed hospitals and government housing compounds, while at least one ministry has been severely damaged. ""Water is scarce, food scarcer,"" said a source in Naypyitaw who, like others, requested anonymity. ""Electrical power is absent. Fuel, medicine, shelter – luxuries now."" The damage extended to the giant presidential palace, where photos published by local media show the wreckage of a gold-lined spiral staircase and chandelier. A junta spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. MINISTRY DAMAGED The foreign ministry, shaped with other ministries like a scorpion's claws believed by some to augur good fortune, has suffered ""severe damage"" and fatalities, according to a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ministry is without power or water and everyone from the minister down is sitting and working at the entrance, the official said. State-run media showed a picture of the foreign minister, Than Swe, participating in an emergency meeting with regional counterparts on Sunday by video, sitting outside a visibly damaged building, curtains dangling from the frames of smashed-in windows. The ministry ""tells us they are no longer in business, no comms or building,"" said a source with knowledge of the matter, adding that staff in Yangon, the former capital and biggest city, had been delegated responsibilities. Initial reports suggest damage to military infrastructure in Naypyitaw has been limited, said Morgan Michaels, Research Fellow for Southeast Asian Security and Defence at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The airport control tower has crumbled, but aircraft hangars appear intact, he said. ""Across the earthquake zone, roads are damaged, and this could impact logistics and deployments in the short term,"" Michaels said. ""But so far it doesn't look like the earthquake will have dealt a serious blow to the military's fighting capacity, from a hardware and infrastructure standpoint."" The military continued to bomb towns even in the aftermath of the disaster, an armed opposition group said on Sunday. Nonetheless, in Buddhist-majority Myanmar - where many ascribe deep astrological significance to natural disasters and successive military leaders have looked to prophecies to guide decisions – some may divine a symbolic blow. ""Even for a rather superstitious country, Min Aung Hlaing is known to be particularly superstitious,"" said Horsey. ""Even if he doesn't believe the earthquake is some form of karmic retribution, he knows that others in his inner circle and the military elite - and the country at large - may well draw that conclusion."" FULL MORGUES The severe impact on Naypyitaw is likely part of the reason the junta quickly appealed for international aid, said Horsey. ""Min Aung Hlaing also knows that this is a moment of considerable risk for his regime - his own patronage networks and the military elite are affected,"" said Horsey. Some commentators have said Naypyitaw appears to be receiving more assistance than the densely populated city of Mandalay and region of Sagaing where entire neighbourhoods were flattened and residents say there has been no visible signs of military mobilisation. But in the capital, too, residents described scenes of unabated suffering. It was mostly children and the elderly who died when several multi-storey buildings housing government staff collapsed during the quake, one resident told Reuters. They heard people among the debris but no help arrived to retrieve those trapped until the following evening. “Rescue didn't arrive in time to so many places,"" she said. The next day, police came to retrieve the dead bodies. Meanwhile, the morgue is full, and has no electricity to keep bodies cold, so many rot on the street outside. ""We didn't receive any food, water, or medical help yet,"" the resident said. ""We are still living on the street outside our building."" (Reporting by Poppy McPherson in Bangkok and Shoon Naing.

Hegseth: US committed to defense of Pacific territories against China,Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reaffirmed the US is committed to defending the Pacific territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands and said any attack on them would be an attack on the mainland.,"Military Hegseth: US committed to defense of Pacific territories against China Guam governor tells US defense secretary there can be no national security without human health security. By Mar-Vic Cagurangan for BenarNews 2025.03.28 HAGATNA, Guam -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reaffirmed the US is committed to defending the Pacific territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands and said any attack on them would be an attack on the mainland. Hegseth touched down in Guam from Hawaii on Thursday as part of a regional tour, his first as defense secretary, in which he is seeking to shore up long-standing alliances to counter China. Amid US-China competition in the Pacific, Guam and the neighboring Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have become increasingly significant in supporting American naval and air operations, especially in the event of a conflict over Taiwan or in the South China Sea. Both territories are within range of Chinese and North Korean ballistic missiles and the U.S. tested a defense system in Guam in December. Any attack on Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands would be met with an ""appropriate response,"" Hegseth said during his brief visit. ""We're defending our homeland,"" Hegseth said. ""Guam and CNMI are vital parts of America and I want to be very clear - to everyone in this room, to the cameras - any attack against these islands is an attack against the U.S."" ""We're going to continue to stay committed to our presence here,"" Hegseth said. ""It's important to emphasize: we are not seeking war with Communist China. But it is our job to ensure that we are ready."" Hegseth's week-long tour comes against a backdrop of Chinese assertiveness. Its coast guard vessels have repeatedly encroached into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea and around the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. His visit will be closely watched in the Pacific for signs of the Trump administration's commitment to traditional allies following a rift between Washington and Europe that has tested the decades-old transatlantic alliance. The trip also threatens to be overshadowed by the fallout from revelations that Hegseth and other national security officials discussed attack plans against Yemen's Houthis on the messaging app Signal with a journalist present. Located closer to Beijing than Hawaii, Guam is known as the ""tip of the spear,"" with 10,000 military personnel, an air base for F-35 fighters and B-2 bombers and home port for Virginia-class nuclear submarines. The security pledge from Hegseth comes as debate on Guam's future as a U.S. territory has intensified, with competing calls by some residents for full statehood and U.N.-mandated decolonization, led by the Indigenous Chamorro people. Defending Guam and CNMI, Hegseth said, aligns with President Donald Trump's ""goal to achieve peace through strength by putting America first."" He delivered remarks at Andersen Air Force Base and took an aerial tour of Guam before meeting with the governors of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands, Lou Leon Guerrero and Arnold Palacios, respectively. Guerrero appealed to Hegseth about the ""great impact"" the U.S. military buildup on Guam has had on the island's residents. The Defense Department controls about a quarter of Guam's land and is preparing to spend billions to upgrade the island's military infrastructure as another 5,000 American marines relocate from Japan's Okinawa islands. ""We welcome you and we welcome the position and the posture that President Trump has,"" Guerrero told Hegseth, during opening statements before their closed door meeting. ""We are the center of gravity here. We are the second island chain of defense,"" she said. ""We want to be a partner in the readiness effort but national security cannot happen without human health security."" Guerrero sought funding for a new hospital, estimated to cost US$600 million. ""Our island needs a regional hospital capable of handling mass casualties, whether from conflict or natural disasters,"" she told Hegseth. Afterwards Guerrero told reporters she didn't have time to discuss the housing crisis caused by the US military buildup. Earlier this month Guerrero warned in her 'state of the island' address of U.S. neglect of Guam's 160,000 residents, where one-in-five are estimated to live below the poverty line. ""Let us be clear about this: Guam cannot be the linchpin of American security in the Asia-Pacific if nearly 14,000 of our residents are without shelter, because housing aid to Guam is cut, or if 36,000 of our people lose access to Medicaid and Medicare coverage keeping them healthy, alive and out of poverty,"" Guerrero said. At the end of his Guam visit, Hegseth announced he'd also reached an ""understanding"" with President Wesley Simina of the Federated States of Micronesia for planning and construction of US$400 million in military infrastructure in Yap state. Simina's office would not confirm to BenarNews he had met with Hegseth in Guam, saying only he was ""off island."" As an unincorporated U.S. territory, Guam residents are American citizens but they cannot vote for the U.S. president and their lone delegate to the Congress has no voting power.

Mandai Rainforest Resort by Banyan Tree marks Banyan Group’s 100th resort and homecoming debut in Singapore,"Opening April 2, 2025, Mandai Rainforest Resort by Banyan Tree offers a nature-inspired stay where every element, from the architecture to the interiors, is designed to harmonise with the environment. Located just a short drive from the city centre ...","Opening April 2, 2025, Mandai Rainforest Resort by Banyan Tree offers a nature-inspired stay where every element, from the architecture to the interiors, is designed to harmonise with the environment. Located just a short drive from the city centre and nestled within the Mandai Wildlife Reserve (Singapore's integrated wildlife and nature destination), the 4.6-hectare resort provides direct access to renowned zoological parks such as Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Wonders, Bird Paradise and the upcoming Rainforest Wild. The resort's design is guided by a deep commitment to biophilia, evident in its architecture, programming, and signature amenities. The resort was designed around the mature trees on the site, while the wings of the resort have been elevated from the ground to accommodate the movement of native wildlife. Drawing inspiration from the rainforest's natural layers and Banyan Group's legacy of honouring the essence of each destination, the 338-room resort - designed by the award-winning WOW Architects - seamlessly integrates with its luxuriant forest scape. Upon arrival at the resort entrance, guests will be greeted by a towering 12-meter-tall Rain Tree (Samanea saman) on one side and an Indian Beech tree (Millettia pinnata) on the other. Retained in their original locations on the site, these two iconic trees symbolise the resort's commitment to blending architecture with nature. The Rain Tree, with its sprawling umbrella-shaped canopy, creates the feeling of stepping into the heart of the rainforest resort, while the native Indian Beech, known for its hardy nature and ability to enrich the soil, provides a nurturing environment for climbers, epiphytes, and a diverse range of animals. Further connecting guests with nature, the lobby is adorned with nature inspired light features that create a harmonious and inviting space, and bespoke furniture such as reception counters and benches incorporated with upcycled wood. As part of the overall stay experience at the resort, associates will share local stories and cultural insights, offering a deeper connection to the destination. Like a seed pod protecting the seeds within, the 24 tree houses offer a cosy and protective shelter to its guests. Each tree house also comes with its own private patio while hovering above ground. The adjacent five-storey resort building including the rooftop, houses 314 guest rooms and suites, is designed to rise vertically through the layers of the forest scape and offer views of the rainforest, garden and the reservoir. Inside the rooms, the design celebrates the forest's complexity through artwork depicting its various layers - the forest floor, understorey, canopy and emergent layers. Antique lithographs of wildlife such as the lesser mousedeer, white-collared kingfisher, Sumatran flying dragon and the grey-headed fish eagle, depict the diverse creatures native to Singapore. Designed with sustainability in mind, the rooms can be naturally ventilated with windows that fully open, and ambient room temperatures are regulated to mirror the cool atmospheric temperatures of the rainforests in the tropics. Each room is equipped with an interactive display that shows power consumption levels and offers gentle reminders when usage exceeds recommended levels. Also, rainwater is collected and repurposed for the flushing system in every room. These mindful touches to the rooms are integral to every stayover and achieving Singapore's Green Mark Platinum first-ever Super Low Energy (SLE) resort. The resort's 300-seater Meranti Ballroom, inspired by the mysterious mythology of the forest floor, offers the ideal venue for momentous celebrations, business meetings and conferences. Its centrepiece design is influenced by the rare Bridal Veil Stinkhorn, a striking mushroom found in tropical environments, which is known for its fascinating hexagonal veil. This captivating focal point sparks conversations about the wonders of fungi and folklore surrounding these enigmatic organisms. The Bridal Room, conveniently located adjacent to the Meranti Ballroom, offers seamless access for the wedding party and effortless preparation and privacy, all while being just steps away from the main event. Drawing on centuries-old Asian traditions, Banyan Tree Spa at the Mandai Rainforest Resort creates an intimate sanctuary with spa pavilions and suites that reflect local inspiration, seamlessly integrated with the natural beauty of its surroundings. The design of the three treatment pods is inspired by the protective keratin scales of the Sunda pangolin, reflected in the external façade. Just as the pangolin's scales shield it from harm, the pods provide a sense of protection and tranquillity. Inside, guests can unwind in a peaceful environment while receiving rejuvenating spa treatments from expert therapists, restoring both mind and body. In addition to the iconic pods, the spa also offers three other treatment rooms, each designed to provide a sanctuary for physical, mental, and spiritual renewal. Guests can look forward to the award-winning Banyan Tree Spa experience, rooted in techniques passed down through generations and the use of natural aromatic oils, herbs, and spices. Staying at Mandai Rainforest Resort by Banyan Tree unlocks exclusive wildlife experiences across the Mandai Wildlife Reserve. From early morning visits to Bird Paradise through the Wild Walk programme, where guests can observe the birds at their most active and interact with the keepers, to the Wild ZooDay Camp - an immersive guided tour for children aged 6 to 10 years old at Singapore Zoo. In addition, resort guests will benefit from special rates on park entry and signature programmes, offering even more opportunities to explore the wildlife wonders at the precinct.

Oregon city at heart of high court homelessness ruling blocked from enforcing camping ban,An Oregon judge has blocked the city at the heart of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on homelessness from enforcing its camping ban unless it meets certain conditions,"Oregon city at heart of high court homelessness ruling blocked from enforcing camping ban An Oregon judge has blocked the city at the heart of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on homelessness from enforcing its camping ban unless it meets certain conditions PORTLAND, Ore. -- An Oregon judge issued a preliminary injunction Friday blocking the city at the heart of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on homeless encampments from enforcing its camping rules unless it meets certain conditions, as part of a lawsuit filed by advocates. Under the decision by Josephine County Circuit Court Judge Sarah McGlaughlin, Grants Pass must increase capacity at city-approved sites for camping and ensure they are physically accessible to people with disabilities. Unless those conditions are met, the order bars the city from citing, arresting or fining people for camping on public property; from forcing people to leave campsites; from removing campsites that are not clearly abandoned; or from prohibiting camping in most city parks. The order still lets the city enforce rules banning sleeping on sidewalks and streets or in alleys and doorways. Mayor Clint Scherf told The Associated Press he was “disheartened” by the decision, and Grants Pass information coordinator Mike Zacchino said via email that the city was “reviewing all aspects to ensure we make the best decision for our community.” The lawsuit was filed by Disability Rights Oregon, which accused the city of discriminating against people with disabilities and violating a state law requiring cities' camping regulations to be “objectively reasonable.” Plaintiffs also included five homeless people in Grants Pass. Grants Pass, a small city of about 40,000 along the Rogue River in the mountains of southern Oregon, has struggled for years to address the homelessness crisis and become emblematic of the national debate over how to deal with it. Its parks in particular became a flashpoint, with many of them becoming the site of encampments blighted by drug use and litter. Last June, in a case brought by the city, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that communities can ban sleeping outside and fine people for doing so, even when there are not enough shelter beds. That overturned a California-based appeals court decision that held that camping bans when shelter space is lacking amounted to cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment. Officials from across the political spectrum filed briefs in that case saying they were hamstrung in their ability to deal with encampments. After the high court ruling, Grants Pass banned camping on all city property except locations designated by the City Council, which established two sites for the town’s hundreds of homeless people in a bid to move them from the parks. Upon taking office in January, the new mayor and new council members moved to close the larger of the two sites, which housed roughly 120 tents, according to the complaint. Meanwhile the smaller one saw its hours of operation reduced to between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m., meaning people had to pack up their belongings every morning. The two sites were frequently crowded, with poor conditions and inaccessible to people with disabilities due to loose gravel, according to the complaint. “It is unconscionable to me to allow people to live there like that,” City Council member Indra Nicholas said before the vote to close the larger site. After the lawsuit was filed, the city reopened a second, smaller site and extended the time people could stay to four days. McGlaughin's order says the city must increase capacity to what it was previously before the larger site was closed. Tom Stenson, deputy legal director for Disability Rights Oregon, called the ruling a victory. “This is not a radical solution. The court is basically saying, ‘Go back to the amount of space and places for people who are homeless that you had just three months ago,’” he told AP. Homelessness increased 18% last year nationwide, driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and an increase in migrants in some parts.

Scenes of destruction in Paros and Mykonos – How they were submerged in just two hours,"The country’s two most popular islands sank in mud – Roads turned into rivers, cars were swept away – Meteorologist Giorgos Tsatrafyllias speaks to protothema.gr
The post Scenes of destruction in Paros and Mykonos – How they were submerged in just two hours a…","Scenes of destruction in Paros and Mykonos – How they were submerged in just two hours The storm that swept through the Cyclades left nothing standing in the “showcases” of Greek tourism. Paros and Mykonos, two of the country’s most popular destinations, were trapped in chaos left behind by a storm with characteristics of a tropical weather phenomenon. In Paros, from early afternoon, the sky darkened and it didn’t take long for the rain to turn roads into raging torrents. Naoussa and Kolymbithres were at the epicenter: flooding, debris, mud, and cars swept away by the waters painted a scene of biblical disaster. For hours, traffic on major roads was impossible, as streams overflowed, roads were split in two, and rocks broke off hillsides, making even access for emergency crews extremely difficult. The Fire Department’s operations center was flooded with calls, while the presence of the police, Civil Protection, and Fire Brigade remained strong throughout the day, on high alert. A helicopter carrying EMAK personnel was dispatched to the island but was unable to land due to the extreme weather. In the afternoon, residents were alerted by a 112 message to avoid all movement, as the weather phenomena were classified as dangerous and out of control. At the same time, it was decided that all schools on the island would remain closed today, Tuesday. A few hours later, Mykonos followed the same path. Hail and rain lashed the island of the winds, causing similar scenes of chaos. Roads turned into rivers and a strict 112 alert instructed residents to avoid using the road network. The torrential waters swept away cars, which became trapped in the island’s narrow alleys. In several areas, water levels exceeded one meter, turning roads into rivers and making it impossible for vehicles and pedestrians to pass. Dozens of residents were forced to stay trapped in their homes, unable to leave, while authorities received a barrage of emergency calls for help. The skies also opened over Syros, while on mainland Greece, the Corinth–Tripoli highway turned white after a fierce hailstorm covered the road, forcing dozens of drivers to stop under bridges for shelter. The emergency weather bulletin from the National Meteorological Service (EMY) remains in effect, with the severe weather system moving toward the Sporades, Thessaly, the Dodecanese, and Crete. However, the wounds left in the Cyclades—especially in Paros and Mykonos—will take time to heal. Tsatrafyllias: “If it rained during Easter in Paros and Mykonos like it did today, what would happen?”With a concerning but entirely realistic scenario, meteorologist Giorgos Tsatrafyllias highlights the serious risks posed by extreme weather phenomena, especially when combined with the lack of preparedness and infrastructure on the Greek islands. Prompted by Monday’s heavy rainfall in Paros and Mykonos—occurring outside the tourist season—the experienced meteorologist raised the following hypothetical but entirely plausible scenario: “In a few days, we’re celebrating Easter, and Paros and Mykonos are expected to be packed with people. If today’s rainfall occurred then (which is not unlikely), what would happen?” he asks pointedly. Why fighter jets are flying today in the Peloponnese and Cyclades Weather today: New 112 alert in Mykonos, roads turn into rivers again – Watch video Severe weather: Provincial roads closed in Halkidiki and Veria – School basement flooded in Thessaloniki According to him, the volume of water that fell on the two islands was impressive and indicative of the intensity of the phenomena: “In just a few hours, Paros received nearly a month’s worth of rain, while Mykonos got twice the amount that usually falls during all of March,” he notes in his comments to protothema.gr. Giorgos Tsatrafyllias stresses that in such a hypothetical scenario, even issuing alerts via 112 would not be enough to effectively protect the population without proper infrastructure and training:“112 on its own is not enough when people are untrained in dealing with natural disasters, let alone when there’s no infrastructure adapted to the new reality!” he warns.

In addition, in many places there is no electricity or internet, and the health system has collapsed. “More than anything, our people need peace, not the churning anxiety triggered by the multidimensional crisis,” emphasized the cardinal, who was traveling in his car when the earthquake struck: “We saw huge craters created on the road … It was a scary moment for all of us.” Bo said he saw “poignant scenes of men and women rushing through the roads, seeking safety,” adding that he has “appealed to all concerned for urgent humanitarian support and unimpeded access to the affected people. I have made an earnest appeal for the ceasefire by all the groups in hostility” in the country’s civil war. The cardinal’s main concern is the distribution of aid, which, due to the violence, “could be hindered with the disturbances of the armed groups.” In response to the earthquake, Bo said he called for an urgent meeting and formed a response protocol named MERCI (Myanmar Earthquake Response Church Initiative) to establish an emergency appeal and response, adding that he also called for a wider meeting including Church and Caritas personnel from all affected areas. “When nature attacks, human beings forget all their differences. Human tears unite us. We survive as species, because we can be moved by others’ tears,” he said, whether in Thailand or Myanmar, because they are “tears of fellowship.” The cardinal then addressed his fellow countrymen and said he shares their pain. “The world feels their pain and we will stand shoulder to shoulder with all people in this moment of sorrow and help to heal their wounds and recover.” He recalled that “we have shown this after the tsunami; we have shown that after the Nargis Cyclone in Myanmar. We will overcome because compassion is the common religion in times of natural disaster.” Bo said that Pope Francis’ words have been “a soothing balm of consolation” and that “despite his recent sickness,” he expressed his closeness to them with a telegram, as he has done “throughout the difficult time in the last four years.” This story was first published by ACI Prensa, CNA’s Spanish-language news partner.

"Without USAID, Myanmar Is Struggling to Recover From Its Massive Earthquake","Chris Milligan arrived in Myanmar in 2012 with a mandate: Help repair diplomatic relations with the southeast Asian country by reopening its United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission.  By that point, Milligan had worked for the USAID …","Chinese rescuers pulled a pregnant survivor from the rubble in Mandalay, Myanmar on Monday morning.Zhang Dongqiang/Xinhua/ZUMA Chris Milligan arrived in Myanmar in 2012 with a mandate: Help repair diplomatic relations with the southeast Asian country by reopening its United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission. By that point, Milligan had worked for the USAID for more than two decades—a tenure that included working on reconstruction in Baghdad following the Iraq War and coordinating the recovery response to Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake. His Myanmar assignment posed a similarly significant challenge: After decades spent under brutal military rule, the country was in the midst of trying to transition to democracy. Reopening the USAID mission in Myanmar, at the American embassy in the city of Yangon, was meant to facilitate that process by helping “reestablish [Myanmar’s] capacity to feed its people and to care for its sick, and educate its children, and build its democratic institutions,” former President Barack Obama said during his 2012 visit to the country—the first by a US president. According to Milligan, the efforts the mission ultimately pursued in Myanmar—such as providing humanitarian assistance, working with local groups to facilitate peace talks, supporting farmers, and partnering with local health organizations to combat diseases—“were really all designed to strengthen the democratic and economic reforms that were ongoing in the country.” “By now, we would have a search and rescue team of hundreds of people on the ground in Myanmar, digging people out of rubble. Now all we’re told is, ‘we may be able to send three people there.’” Fast forward to now, and that progress has been decimated, with USAID missions shuttered around the world after the Trump administration reportedly fired all but 15 legally required positions of the agency’s global staff, throwing it into chaos. In Myanmar—where a civil war has been raging since 2021, when the country plunged back into military rule—the significance of the cuts to USAID is becoming devastatingly clear, as the country reels from the 7.7-magnitude earthquake that hit Friday, killing at least 2,700 people and leaving more than 3,900 injured, according to Myanmar officials. (The US Geological Survey estimates fatalities are actually north of 10,000, and that the economic losses could exceed the country’s GDP.) There are no US officials currently on the ground, and the New York Times reports that a three-person USAID team is not expected to arrive until Wednesday, citing a source with knowledge of the deployment efforts. Even before the earthquake, there were nearly 20 million people in the country in need of humanitarian assistance, a UN official has said. On Sunday, the US Embassy in Myanmar announced that the American government would provide up to $2 million towards recovery efforts—an amount that Milligan says is paltry compared to prior support for similar natural disasters, like the more than $2 billion USAID committed to recovery efforts in the decade after the 2010 quake in Haiti. On Monday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters at a press briefing she rejected the notion that USAID cuts were impacting the earthquake response, claiming, “people are on the ground,” and then confusingly adding, “I would reject the premise that the sign of success is that we are physically there.” The State Department did not respond to questions from Mother Jones for this story. I spoke with Milligan, who retired from USAID in 2021, via Zoom on Tuesday about the inadequacy of the US response to the earthquake recovery and its impacts on citizens of Myanmar; how the absence of American forces on the ground could give China and Russia a geopolitical edge; and how the recovery effort would be different if USAID were still intact. This interview has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity. The State Department claims the cuts to USAID have not impacted their ability to assist with recovery efforts on the ground in Myanmar. Is this plausible? When you dismantle an entire bureau of thousands of people who provide humanitarian assistance, no, it’s not plausible that there’s no impact on the US government’s authority to provide humanitarian assistance. And what we’re seeing is that impact. At this stage normally, we would have a disaster assistance response team (DART) on the ground. The initial wave of experts would be on the ground within hours, and then the DART would then grow. So, for example, following the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, we had a DART of 200 people on the ground; 160 of them were search and rescue individuals. “We have the capacity, we have the ability, and we have the assets to save lives, and the choice has been not to use it, and people are dying.” By now, we would have a search and rescue team of hundreds of people on the ground in Myanmar, digging people out of rubble. Now all we’re told is, ‘we may be able to send three people there.’ USAID still maintains humanitarian assistance advisors, who have a specialty in the overall establishment of humanitarian assistance. But the provision of humanitarian assistance requires highly developed technical skills: You need someone who knows all about potable water and child protection; you need security; you need shelter experts; you need communication experts; you need food security experts. That’s why the DART is full of these experts who have careers in delivering this kind of assistance. So to say that’s been replaced by three people and $2 million is ludicrous. Meanwhile, China and Russia and others have scrambled with larger teams. They’re actually providing the support that’s required, but it’s not filling the gap of what we would do with a team of 200 people on the ground. Help contextualize the $2 million American officials said they will provide to Myanmar for recovery—is it adequate, and how does it compare to how the US previously responded to natural disasters like this, in Myanmar or elsewhere? This is not adequate. Generally, the US government makes a small pledge, and then builds upon the pledge. So hopefully, the $2 million is seed money, and then there’ll be more funding forthcoming. “The world is wondering why the country with the most developed expertise, that has the capacity, that has the resources, isn’t stepping up and helping.” The scale of assistance can vary. On one hand, the response to the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010—in which we scrambled and provided enormous assistance to the 1.4 million people who were displaced and who needed food and shelter and help—was about a billion dollars within six months. The support we provided following the 2008 Cyclone Nargis—Myanmar’s worst natural disaster in history, which killed more than 80,000 people—was $196 million over the following four years. So $2 million is not going to have much of an impact at all, and it fails by comparison, because we know that China is already at $14 million. The world is wondering why the country with the most developed expertise, that has the capacity, that has the resources, isn’t stepping up and helping at this time. I know you worked on the earthquake response in Haiti for USAID. What are the challenges that a place like Haiti, or Myanmar, have in responding to an earthquake, and what role did foreign assistance from USAID typically play in rebuilding? Although no two disasters are the same, they do follow similar processes. What you want to do initially is save lives. You want to get people out of rubble, you want to provide emergency shelter, water, food, health care. Secondly, you want to avoid a second rate of death that comes from the spread of diseases, cholera, lack of food. You want to avoid conflict over scarce resources. So there is a rhythm to a response: immediate life saving, relief, recovery, and then finally, back to development. It’s a continuum shared between Haiti or Myanmar, even though the context is always different. In Myanmar, you have no central government, really. You have a brutal civil war. It’s more difficult for a national level response. Not only were transportation networks destroyed by the earthquake, they’ve been destroyed by the civil war, and you can’t freely move goods across the country because different territories and land are held by different factions. It’s very difficult to mobilize international support that’s needed to rebuild and recover because of the lack of a legitimate government to work with. I wanted to ask you about China and Russia, given reports that they are among the countries that have sent teams of people to Myanmar to help rescue people from the rubble and assist with on-the-ground recovery. What impacts could their assistance have on building their soft power in the region and undermining US interests? The United States government provides humanitarian assistance based upon need, not on politics. However, there are enormous dividends to doing so. First of all, it showcases American values of generosity and compassion. It links America directly to communities overseas. It creates enormous goodwill. It increases our diplomatic power as well. China already is the major trading power for 120 countries around the world. It’s one of the largest creditor nations in the world. So it has stronger and deeper economic ties to most countries in the world than the United States does. By getting rid of the economic work that USAID does, we’re strengthening China’s economic ties with the world, and by walking away from the work that we do, we’re creating a political vacuum that China is filling. China needs a world that looks like China. That’s what countries do: they work in their own national interest. The work that we do to build stable, safe, prosperous democracy overseas has all stopped. The support we provide to human rights actors has stopped. The support we provide for free press, free information, has stopped. China will take advantage of this to conform the world for its own benefit at our cost. The location of the USAID mission is in Yangon, which is the southern part of the country, not in proximity to the earthquake. Certainly they felt the shocks, but the destruction was in the second largest city further north, Mandalay, and then more disruption in the capital Naypyidaw. I’ve been in touch to share my concerns with people there. Very few of them have been able to travel to the earthquake zone. The American staff have all received their termination letters, and the administration has notified Congress that it will be terminating all the local hires as well. “We are going to turn our backs on those who serve the US government and also serve their own country by trying to bring reforms to it.” These local hires have spent decades, some of them, working for USAID and the US government, and they’re just going to be let go and dropped—and they will be in a risky situation, because the military government knows who they are and what they’ve been doing. We are going to turn our backs on those who serve the United States government and also serve their own country by trying to bring reforms to it. How do you think the US response would differ if USAID was still intact? How would things look different on the ground? If USAID were still intact, we would have a large disaster assistance response team on the ground. We would have mobilized urban search and rescue teams from Los Angeles County and Fairfax County, Virginia; they would be there with the sniffer dogs and the equipment necessary to pull people out of the rubble. We would have experts—in nutrition, food, water, shelter, protection—on the ground; they would be working with the other donors to find out where the needs are, where are the gaps, and how the United States government can best help. We would be supporting the international coordination effort, which would be led by the UN but with our support. And so what you would have is a more robust international effort, and you’d ultimately be saving more lives. We have the capacity, we have the ability, and we have the assets to save lives, and the choice has been not to use it, and people are dying. Related South Carolina Attacked Planned Parenthood.

Real GDP is forecast to grow 0.9 per cent in 2025, followed by 1.9 per cent expansion in 2026. “Weak consumer confidence is encouraging precautionary savings among households, something we see only gradually recovering after the trade dispute with the U.S. is resolved, but businesses could remain cautious for a while,” stated Cory Renner, Associate Director, Economic Forecasting at The Conference Board of Canada. “The resource sector will be a bright spot for Canada, as the United States will continue to need Canada’s energy products, but manufacturing will feel the impacts.” Canada’s economy will see short term pain in the second quarter, assuming tariffs from the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs from other countries, including China, Mexico, and the European Union, remain in place through the spring. The Conference Board of Canada forecasts 160,000 jobs will be lost, with nearly half of those coming in the manufacturing sector under its tariff assumptions. Real exports will fall by almost one-third, with motor vehicle and parts exports dropping by over 50 per cent, stifling business investment as many companies cut production, while delaying or cancelling investment plans. The economy will turn the corner in the third quarter, according to The Conference Board of Canada, as a three-month duration of widespread tariffs would be short enough to allow a swift economic recovery. Fiscal measures targeted toward consumers and businesses will provide shelter to incomes and keep many businesses afloat during the steep downturn in the second quarter, enabling household spending and hiring to pick up shortly after. The anticipated trade war is already impacting Canada’s labour market, with heightened uncertainty stalling job growth in February. There will be a swift recovery, assuming the tariffs are only in place for three months, however it will not be evenly recognized across all industries. The manufacturing sector is likely to face prolonged challenges due to lingering economic uncertainty. Concerns about potential future tariffs and weakened business confidence may prompt some companies to delay expansions and hiring plans well beyond 2025. Canadians’ appetite for spending has soured as consumers are bracing themselves for the tariff impacts. The federal GST holiday helped keep headline consumer price index growth down artificially between December and February. Federal and provincial retaliatory measures spurred by U.S. tariff actions are also adding upward pressure to inflation. At the same time, the push to “Buy Canadian” will encourage consumers to substitute away from U.S. imports. Uncertainty in the oil sector has customarily stemmed from factors such as stricter environmental regulations and a lack of major pipeline projects on the horizon. However, the Trump administration’s tariff regime has added a new layer of instability, affecting everything from production to pricing. While the near-term oil outlook has dimmed, natural gas prospects are strengthening. A cold start to the year boosted consumption and prices, driving inventories below five-year averages. With global LNG demand rising, LNG Canada remains on track for first shipments by mid-2025, targeting Asian markets. Uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs and Canada’s retaliation to them are dominating the international trade outlook in the immediate term. Although The Conference Board of Canada assumes most protectionist measures will last for only three months, the damage to some export segments, particularly in manufacturing, will be long-lasting. All in all, Canada’s exports of goods and services are forecast to contract by 0.7 per cent this year before rebounding with 3.5 per cent growth in 2026. Despite the headwinds, the import sector is still expected to record positive, albeit tepid, growth this year. Recession fears laid to rest last year have arisen again as the country braces for President Trump’s dangerously protectionist policy changes. Tariffs, both threatened and imposed by the Trump administration have incited trade wars with America’s neighbours, partners, and allies, and would lead American consumers to pay higher prices.

Cockroaches,"Though cockroaches are insects commonly associated with human dwellings, only about 20 of the 3,500 known species are suited to thrive in the typical home. Once a home is infested, however, it is extremely difficult to eradicate the pest. One of the world's h…","cockroach Blaberidae Blattidae Corydiidae Cryptocercidae Ectobiidae Lamproblattidae Nocticolidae Tryonicidae Cockroaches are insects of the order Blattodea, which also includes termites. About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats. About four species are well known as pests. The cockroaches are an ancient group, dating back at least as far as the Carboniferous period, some 320 million years ago. Those early ancestors however lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches. Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of aphids and other true bugs; they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living neopteran insects. They are common and hardy insects, and can tolerate a wide range of environments from Arctic cold to tropical heat. Tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species, and, contrary to popular belief, extinct cockroach relatives and 'roachoids' such as the Carboniferous Archimylacris and the Permian Apthoroblattina were not as large as the biggest modern species. Some species, such as the gregarious German cockroach, have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition. Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity. They are popularly depicted as dirty pests, though the great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world. Taxonomy and evolution Cockroaches are members of the order Blattodea, which includes the termites, a group of insects once thought to be separate from cockroaches. Currently, 4,600 species and over 460 genera are described worldwide.[1][2] The name ""cockroach"" comes from the Spanish word for cockroach, cucaracha, transformed by 1620s English folk etymology into ""cock"" and ""roach"".[3] The scientific name derives from the Latin blatta, ""an insect that shuns the light"", which in classical Latin was applied not only to cockroaches, but also to mantids.[4][5] Historically, the name Blattaria was used largely interchangeably with the name Blattodea, but whilst the former name was used to refer to 'true' cockroaches exclusively, the latter also includes the termites. The current catalogue of world cockroach species uses the name Blattodea for the group.[1] Another name, Blattoptera, is also sometimes used.[6] The earliest cockroach-like fossils (""blattopterans"" or ""roachids"") are from the Carboniferous period 320 million years ago, as are fossil roachoid nymphs.[7][8][9] Since the 19th century, scientists believed that cockroaches were an ancient group of insects that had a Devonian origin, according to one hypothesis.[10] Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in having long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises, as well as modern blattodeans. As the body, hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently, the relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroaches remains disputed. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appeared in the early Cretaceous. A recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroaches originated at least in the Jurassic.[10] The evolutionary relationships of the Blattodea (cockroaches and termites) shown in the cladogram are based on Eggleton, Beccaloni & Inward (2007).[11] The cockroach families Lamproblattidae and Tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily Blattoidea. The cockroach families Corydiidae and Ectobiidae were previously known as the Polyphagidae and Blattellidae.[12] Termitidae Rhinotermitidae Kalotermitidae Termopsidae Hodotermitidae Mastotermitidae Cryptocercidae (brown-hooded cockroaches) Blattidae (Oriental, American and other cockroaches) Blaberidae (Giant cockroaches) Ectobiidae (part) Ectobiidae (part) Corydiidae (Sand cockroaches, etc) Nocticolidae (Cave cockroaches, etc) Mantodea (Mantises) Termites were previously regarded as a separate order Isoptera to cockroaches. However, recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from 'true' cockroaches, and many authors now place them as an ""epifamily"" of Blattodea.[11] This evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in 1934 that termites are closely related to the wood-eating cockroaches (genus Cryptocercus). This hypothesis was originally based on similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in termites regarded as living fossils and wood-eating cockroaches.[13] Additional evidence emerged when F. A. McKittrick (1965) noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and cockroach nymphs.[14] The similarities among these cockroaches and termites have led some scientists to reclassify termites as a single family, the Termitidae, within the order Blattodea.[11][15] Other scientists have taken a more conservative approach, proposing to retain the termites as the Termitoidea, an epifamily within the order. Such measure preserves the classification of termites at family level and below.[16] Description Most species of cockroach are about the size of a thumbnail, but several species are bigger. The world's heaviest cockroach is the Australian giant burrowing cockroach Macropanesthia rhinoceros, which can reach 9 cm (3.5 in) in length and weigh more than 30 g (1.1 oz).[17] Comparable in size is the Central American giant cockroach Blaberus giganteus, which grows to a similar length.[18] The longest cockroach species is Megaloblatta longipennis, which can reach 97 mm (3.8 in) in length and 45 mm (1.8 in) across.[19] A Central and South American species, Megaloblatta blaberoides, has the largest wingspan of up to 185 mm (7.3 in).[20] Cockroaches are generalized insects, with few special adaptations, and may be among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.[21] The body is divided into a thorax of three segments and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings are attached to the second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.[22] The three pairs of legs are sturdy, with large coxae and five claws each.[22] They are attached to each of the three thoracic segments. The front legs are the shortest and the hind legs the longest, providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs.[21] The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory, but observations of the insect's gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs.[23][24] The abdomen has ten segments, each with a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the external genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.[21] Distribution and habitat Cockroaches are abundant throughout the world and live in a wide range of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics.[25] Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of −188 °F (−122 °C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol.[26] In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent.[25] 450 species are found in Australia.[27] Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.[28][29] Cockroaches occupy a wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in cavities under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they may be one of the main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.[30] Behavior Cockroaches are social insects; a large number of species are either gregarious or inclined to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care.[31] It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient.[31] Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.[32] Daily rhythms may also be regulated by a complex set of hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood. In 2005, the role of one of these proteins, pigment dispersing factor (PDF), was isolated and found to be a key mediator in the circadian rhythms of the cockroach.[33] Pest species adapt readily to a variety of environments, but prefer warm conditions found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal[34] and run away when exposed to light. An exception to this is the Asian cockroach, which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces and pale colors.[35] Collective decision-making Gregarious cockroaches display collective decision-making when choosing food sources. When a sufficient number of individuals (a ""quorum"") exploits a food source, this signals to newcomer cockroaches that they should stay there longer rather than leave for elsewhere.[36] Other mathematical models have been developed to explain aggregation dynamics and conspecific recognition.[37][38] Group-based decision-making is responsible for complex behaviors such as resource allocation. In a study where 50 cockroaches were placed in a dish with three shelters with a capacity for 40 insects in each, the insects arranged themselves in two shelters with 25 insects in each, leaving the third shelter empty. When the capacity of the shelters was increased to more than 50 insects per shelter, all of the cockroaches arranged themselves in one shelter. Cooperation and competition are balanced in cockroach group decision-making behavior.[32] Cockroaches appear to use just two pieces of information to decide where to go, namely how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.[39] Social behavior Gregarious German cockroaches show different behavior when reared in isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches were less likely to leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.[40] Individual American cockroaches appear to have consistently different ""personalities"" regarding how they seek shelter. In addition, group personality is not simply the sum of individual choices, but reflects conformity and collective decision-making.[41][42] The gregarious German and American cockroaches have elaborate social structure, chemical signalling, and ""social herd"" characteristics. Lihoreau and his fellow researchers stated:[32] Sounds Some species make a hissing noise while other cockroaches make a chirping noise. The Madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles on the fourth abdominal segment. Several different hisses are produced, including disturbance sounds, produced by adults and larger nymphs, and aggressive, courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult males.[43] Henschoutedenia epilamproides has a stridulatory organ between its thorax and abdomen, but the purpose of the sound produced is unclear.[44] Several Australian species practice acoustic and vibration behavior as an aspect of courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles. Furthermore, in the presence of a potential mate, some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia's tropics.[45] Biology Digestive tract Cockroaches are generally omnivorous; the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds on a great variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing.[46] Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.[47] The similarity of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus to those in termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches,[48] and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships.[49] All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach.[50][51] It had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. cuenoti. It may be that N. australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts, or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be re-examined.[51] Tracheae and breathing Like other insects, cockroaches breathe through a system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments. When the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough, valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in. The tracheal system branches repeatedly, the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell, allowing gaseous exchange to take place.[52] While cockroaches do not have lungs as do vertebrates, and can continue to respire if their heads are removed, in some very large species, the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air in and out of the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing.[52] Reproduction Cockroaches use pheromones to attract mates, and the males practice courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate facing away from each other with their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males.[22] Female cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches.[22] Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of her life.[22] The female usually attaches the egg case to a substrate, inserts it into a suitably protective crevice, or carries it about until just before the eggs hatch. Some species, however, are ovoviviparous, keeping the eggs inside their body, with or without an egg case, until they hatch. At least one genus, Diploptera, is fully viviparous.[22] Cockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis, meaning that the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and may take a few months to over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory.[22] 3 millimeter cockroach nymph Female Periplaneta fuliginosa with ootheca Empty ootheca American cockroach oothecae Hardiness Cockroaches are among the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of remaining active for a month without food and are able to survive on limited resources, such as the glue from the back of postage stamps.[53] Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which Hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5 °C to −8 °C in laboratory experiments.[54] Experiments on decapitated specimens of several species of cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained, including shock avoidance and escape behavior, although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation, and popular claims of the longevity of headless cockroaches do not appear to be based on published research.[55][56] The severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours, or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients.[56] It is popularly suggested that cockroaches will ""inherit the earth"" if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war. Cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates, with the lethal dose perhaps six to 15 times that for humans. However, they are not exceptionally radiation-resistant compared to other insects, such as the fruit fly.[57] The cockroach's ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are most vulnerable to the effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.[52] Relationship with humans In research and education Because of their ease of rearing and resilience, cockroaches have been used as insect models in the laboratory, particularly in the fields of neurobiology, reproductive physiology and social behavior.[31] The cockroach is a convenient insect to study as it is large and simple to raise in a laboratory environment. This makes it suitable both for research and for school and undergraduate biology studies. It can be used in experiments on topics such as learning, sexual pheromones, spatial orientation, aggression, activity rhythms and the biological clock, and behavioral ecology.[58] As pests The Blattodea include some thirty species of cockroaches associated with humans; these species are atypical of the thousands of species in the order.[59] They feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor.[60] They can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces, particularly in environments such as hospitals.[61][62] Cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans.[63][64] One of the proteins that trigger allergic reactions is tropomyosin.[65] These allergens are also linked with asthma.[66] About 60% of asthma patients in Chicago are also sensitive to cockroach allergens. Studies similar to this have been done globally and all the results are similar. Cockroaches can live for a few days up to a month without food, so just because no cockroaches are visible in a home does not mean they are not there. Approximately 20-48% of homes with no visible sign of cockroaches have detectable cockroach allergens in dust.[67] Many remedies have been tried in the search for control of the major pest species of cockroaches, which are resilient and fast-breeding. Household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been suggested, without evidence for their effectiveness.[68] Garden herbs including Bay leaves, catnip, mint, cucumber, and garlic have been proposed as repellents.[69] Poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or fipronil, and boric acid powder is effective on adults.[70] Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Alternatively, insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective.[70] In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles.[71] Few parasites and predators are effective for Biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp to deliver a second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.[72] Cockroaches can be trapped in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that cockroaches can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar can be used to drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.[73] As food Although considered disgusting in Western culture, cockroaches are eaten in many places around the world.[74][75] Whereas household pest cockroaches may carry bacteria and viruses, cockroaches bred under laboratory conditions can be used to prepare nutritious food.[76] Common household cockroaches can be decontaminated by being isolated and fed a diet of apple and lettuce.[74] In Mexico and Thailand, the heads and legs are removed, and the remainder may be boiled, sauted, grilled, dried or diced.[74] In China, cockroaches have become popular as medicine and cockroach farming is rising. The cockroaches are fried twice in a wok of hot oil, which makes them crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese.[77][78] Fried cockroaches are ground and sold as pills for stomach, heart and liver diseases.[79] A cockroach recipe from Formosa (Taiwan) specifies salting and frying cockroaches after removing the head and entrails.[80] In 1905, Henri Coupin wrote a French book Les bizarreries des races humaines, which mentions a cockroach paste recipe used by the English and the Irish people. After being simmered in vinegar and dried in the sun, the cockroaches' heads and intestines are removed, and they are boiled with butter, salt and pepper, made into a paste, and spread on bread. But there is no other evidence of this recipe. The only confirmed edible use of cockroaches by the British is the use of Periplaneta americana feces in homeopathic medicine.[80] According to International Union of Crystallography journal, the ""milk"" produced by the Pacific beetle cockroach (Diploptera punctata) is one of the most nutritious foods on earth.[81] Conservation While a small minority of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity.[82] Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi.[83][84] Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these are threatened by a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species, but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic.[85] In culture Cockroaches were known and considered repellent but useful in medicines in Classical times. An insect named in Greek ""σίλφη"" (""Silphe"") has been identified with the cockroach. It is mentioned by Aristotle, saying that it sheds its skin; it is described as foul-smelling in Aristophanes' play Peace; Euenus called it a pest of book collections, being ""page-eating, destructive, black-bodied"" in his Analect. Virgil named the cockroach ""Lucifuga"" (""one that avoids light""). Pliny the Elder recorded the use of ""Blatta"" in various medicines; he describes the insect as disgusting, and as seeking out dark corners to avoid the light.[86][87] Dioscorides recorded the use of the ""Silphe"", ground up with oil, as a remedy for earache.[87] Lafcadio Hearn (1850–1904) asserted that ""For tetanus cockroach tea is given. I do not know how many cockroaches go to make up the cup; but I find that faith in this remedy is strong among many of the American population of New Orleans. A poultice of boiled cockroaches is placed over the wound."" He adds that cockroaches are eaten, fried with garlic, for indigestion.[88] Several cockroach species, such as Blaptica dubia, are raised as food for insectivorous pets.[89] A few cockroach species are raised as pets, most commonly the giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa.[90] Whilst the hissing cockroaches may be the most commonly kept species, there are many species that are kept by cockroach enthusiasts; there is even a specialist society: the Blattodea Culture Group (BCG), which was a thriving organisation for about 15 years although now appears to be dormant.[91] The BCG provided a source of literature for people interested in rearing cockroaches which was otherwise limited to either scientific papers, or general insect books, or books covering a variety of exotic pets; in the absence of an inclusive book one member published Introduction to Rearing Cockroaches which still appears to be the only book dedicated to rearing cockroaches.[92] Cockroaches have been used for space tests. A cockroach given the name Nadezhda was sent into space by Russian scientists during Foton-M test, becoming the first terrestrial animal to ""give birth"" in space.[93] Because of their long association with humans, cockroaches are frequently referred to in popular culture. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests.[94][95] In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and found their way to the bakeries, after the sailing ship Gothenburg ran aground and was destroyed by rocks.[96] Donald Harington's satirical novel The Cockroaches of Stay More (Harcourt, 1989) imagines a community of ""roosterroaches"" in a mythical Ozark town where the insects are named after their human counterparts. Madonna has famously quoted, ""I am a survivor. I am like a cockroach, you just can't get rid of me.""[97] An urban legend maintains that cockroaches are immortal.[98] See also References External links",https://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/cockroach,2025-04-02T04:24:09Z

This primarily quantitative work has not examined how the unique context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. may have shaped motivations for alcohol use during this crisis. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an analysis of qualitative data from in-depth interviews examining people’s motivations for using alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants (N = 26) were derived from those who completed all three waves of the National Alcohol Survey COVID Cohort- a longitudinal population-based survey of non-institutionalized U.S. adults. Interviews were conducted from April-July 2022 over Zoom. Interview transcripts were analyzed iteratively via codebook thematic analysis. Results Participants described how both contextual and individual level factors resulted in increased alcohol use. Contextual factors included reductions in barriers to alcohol use and increases in alcohol availability and accessibility. Individual level factors included using alcohol to regulate emotions (e.g., to alleviate boredom and as an end of day “reward”) and to celebrate reconnecting with loved ones once social distancing restrictions began to ease. Conclusions Our results suggest that environmental forces may have interacted with individuals’ emotions to shape alcohol use motivations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work helps to contextualize quantitative research on changes in alcohol use observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. More research is needed to determine the long-term impacts of pandemic era changes in alcohol use. It is also necessary for future studies to examine how such impacts may manifest differently across the U.S. population (e.g., among racial/ethnic minority individuals).

Introduction The United States (U.S.) is one of the few high-income countries that experienced an average increase in alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic [1,2]. Cross-sectional, retrospective studies conducted early in the pandemic showed increases in drinking frequency [3], drinks per month [4,5], drinking days [6], and binge drinking [7], and longitudinal cohort studies supported these observations [2,8,9]. For example, data from the National Alcohol Survey COVID Cohort (NAS-C19) showed increases in alcohol use and symptoms of alcohol use disorder in the first year of the pandemic, driven by an increase in spirits use and frequency of drinking rather than increases in average quantity per occasion [2]. Additionally, per capita alcohol consumption increased by 5.5% from 2019 to 2021, the largest two-year increase since 1969 [10]. Increases in alcohol use during the pandemic, however, varied across populations [2], with women [11], Black people [2,7], people with mental health problems [12,13], and those engaging in heavy alcohol use before the pandemic [14–16] being especially likely to report increases in drinking. These increases align with previous research showing higher alcohol use after exposure to natural disasters and human-caused crises [17–19]. In the U.S., people exposed to trauma from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and first responders to Hurricane Katrina increased their alcohol use, some up to years afterward [20–23]. The psychosocial and behavioral mechanisms through which these disasters impacted alcohol use include symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder [24] and reduced social cohesion [25]. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, differed from other modern-day disasters, and thus may have impacted alcohol use both through previously identified mechanisms and those unique to an infectious disease pandemic. Unlike previous crises, the COVID-19 pandemic required people to restrict social interactions (e.g., stay-at-home orders, self-quarantines, etc.) for prolonged periods. Reviews of the psychological impacts of quarantine report that protracted social isolation due to quarantining was associated with feelings of confusion and boredom, and negative mental health effects including anxiety and depression [26,27]. Important for understanding reasons for using alcohol during the pandemic in the U.S., research among U.S. respondents shows that social isolation and loneliness resulting from COVID-19 quarantines were associated with increased alcohol use during the pandemic [28]. Quantitative investigations designed to understand reasons for increased alcohol use in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic have identified economic [12], family [29], and mental health stressors [12] as drivers of increased alcohol use. In addition, other motives related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been identified. For example, a study using national Monitoring the Future data to examine trends in alcohol use and drinking context and reasons among young and middle-aged adults observed that increases in alcohol use were associated with motives to relax/relieve tension and alleviate boredom resultant of the pandemic, for example due to stay-at-home directives [3]. Similarly, a study using National Alcohol Survey data observed that reports of drinking to forget one’s worries and problems were higher in the early-COVID-19 period relative to the period just prior [11]. A number of studies identified associations between drinking to cope and increased alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic among a variety of populations including residents of Harlem, New York City [30], college students [31,32], women [33], women who parent [34], and members of the LGBTQ + community [35,36]. Although such research is vital for identifying factors associated with observed increases in alcohol use during the pandemic, they are of limited use in elucidating participants’ rationale for drinking. That is, unlike qualitative data, quantitative data cannot tell us how people perceived the ways that U.S.-specific environmental forces unique to the COVID-19 pandemic interacted with their affective states to shape thought processes and motivations for alcohol use during this global crisis [37]. Relative to quantitative studies, limited qualitative research to date has examined motives for alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. For example, Finlay et. al. examined motives for alcohol use among older adults and observed that those who increased their alcohol consumption did so to relax, enjoy an evening routine, or “get drunk” [38]. A descriptive phenomenological study of sexual minority women (e.g., self-identified lesbians) reported that changes in routine, and seeking recreation and relief were associated with alcohol and cannabis use [39]. An online study of U.S. veterans who reported substance use issues during the COVID-19 pandemic used a single item asking the participant to “describe anything else related to the impact of coronavirus on you, such as your use of substances/alcohol, mood, relationships, or health” [40]. Narrative responses were examined using a modified consensual qualitative approach and found that increased psychological distress, reduced access to recreational options, feelings of loneliness/isolation and relationship issues impacted participants’ substance use. A follow-up to the Eating and Activity over Time cohort study among young people in Minneapolis-St. Paul also used open-ended items to assess experiences of stress, stress management, and substance use among participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an inductive approach to thematic analysis the study reported that participants engaged in alcohol use as a strategy for managing stress during the pandemic [41]. Taken together, qualitative literature suggests a variety of motives for using alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from wanting to relax to coping with negative feelings resulting from living through a global crisis. However, the limited number of studies and use of narrative, written responses to open-ended questions on surveys are a limitation. Written survey responses are not analogous to in-depth conversations about the motives and circumstances for using alcohol during the pandemic. Open-ended survey question responses can be valuable data, but they lack “richness” [42]- they are often short and lack information on the social, contextual, and/or personal factors that impact behavior. Further, the nature of surveys precludes follow-up questions that would contextualize or clarify responses. Data derived from such methods are of limited use in drawing inferences about the lived experiences and motivations for using alcohol during a pandemic. Understanding the nuanced and in-depth aspects of people’s reasons for using alcohol during a global pandemic can inform concerted responses to support people during crises in the future. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed qualitative data from in-depth interviews with participants of the NAS-C19 [2]. We aimed to describe the range of motivations for using alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S.-based individuals. Methods Sample This qualitative study (N = 26) drew participants from the NAS-C19, a longitudinal population-based survey of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 or older across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The NAS-C19 included three waves of data collection: 2019-2020 (Wave 1, pre-pandemic), in 2021 (Wave 2), and in 2022 (Wave 3). Participants completed measures of alcohol use and alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptomology at each survey via items derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual – Fifth Edition (DSM-V; [43]). Participants in Wave 1 were sampled using both probability-based (random digit dialing with computer assisted telephone interviews and address-based sampling via an online survey) and non-probability-based (web panel) approaches and included oversamples of Black and Hispanic/Latinx people. For more details on NAS-C19 procedures, see Kerr et al. [2]. Eligibility criteria for the current subsample included 1) completion of all survey waves, and 2) self-reported past-year drinking above National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines: that is, > 5 drinks/day or > 15 drinks/week for men; > 4 drinks/day or > 8 drinks/week for women [44] at Wave 2. Procedures Eligible NAS-C19 participants were invited to participate in the present study at the end of their Wave 3 survey. Wave 3 of the survey was conducted from March 16th - June 21st, 2022. Interested participants were contacted up to three times via email about participation. Participants were informed about the interview topic and procedures, scheduling logistics, and the gift card they would receive after participation. Interested respondents were scheduled for an hour-and-a-half-long study appointment over Zoom. The response rate for the qualitative interviews was 29.5%. All study interviews occurred between April 11th and July 6th of 2022. Before beginning the interviews, interviewers gave an overview of the study’s purpose and obtained verbal consent for participation. Then, the interviewer conducted a semi-structured interview using an interview guide with a priori questions. All participants were asked the same questions (e.g., thoughts and feelings about using alcohol during the pandemic), but interviewers had the flexibility to explore topics organically as they arose during the interview. Participants described their drinking over the course of the prior year, and the participant and interviewer worked together to note major life events in the participant’s life that occurred during the prior 12 months to aid participants’ recall of their alcohol use during that time frame. Participants were asked about stressful experiences that occurred, when they were drinking the most/least, how they understood these periods of drinking the most/least (i.e., what thoughts and feelings they had about these periods, motivations for using alcohol or not), and how their alcohol use during the period compared to their alcohol use pre-pandemic. Significant life events were probed for their associations with alcohol use, as were perceptions of how alcohol use may have affected later life events. After the interview, the first 22 participants were sent a gift card for $50. Towards the end of the study, the incentive was increased to improve recruitment resulting in the last four participants receiving a $75 gift card. All procedures were approved by the Public Health Institute institutional review board. Analysis All interviews were professionally transcribed. Transcripts were then analyzed using codebook thematic analysis, an iterative technique in which initial broad research questions inform the abductive generation of themes [45]. When using thematic analysis, initial primary (open) codes are developed, and then connected to other related themes to form overarching secondary codes that are developed into themes. Our analysis occurred as follows: First, authors one and two independently performed open coding of two full transcripts. Emerging themes were discussed between the two primary coders and author three until consensus was reached. Next, authors one and two independently coded additional transcripts, discussing emerging themes, coding agreement, and iteratively developing the codebook (managed by author one). When coding a new transcript did not result in identification of potential new themes, the codebook was determined to be complete and authors one and two reviewed their coding of early transcripts to confirm all codes in the final codebook were applied as relevant, and to determine agreement between the two coders. Throughout analysis, authors one, two, and three met weekly to discuss coding and address discrepancies until all transcripts were coded. All transcripts were double-coded. Results Sample demographics are available in Table 1. Participants’ self-reported alcohol use behavior and alcohol use disorder symptomology (both pre- and post-COVID) are available in Table 2. Our analysis revealed that participants’ alcohol use was shaped by both contextual and individual-level factors (for a summary of identified themes and exemplary quotes see Supplementary Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319977.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319977.t002 Contextual factors Analysis of interview transcripts revealed that the social and environmental conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic led to participants experiencing multiple facilitators of alcohol use which resulted in participants’ alcohol use increasing relative to pre-pandemic. Three such facilitators included 1) a reduction in barriers to alcohol use, 2) the increased availability of alcohol (i.e., the ease with which participants could acquire alcohol), and 3) the increased accessibility of alcohol (i.e., the ease with which participants could consume alcohol). Theme 1: During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants encountered fewer barriers to alcohol use resulting in changes to their drinking patterns Participants reported that an effect of stay-at-home orders and restrictions on movement during the COVID-19 pandemic was a reduction in barriers to drinking. That is, factors which would usually present an obstacle to drinking pre-pandemic no longer applied during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such obstacles could be physical (e.g., having to travel to a bar to drink alcohol) or social (e.g., normative beliefs about when alcohol should be consumed). The removal of such obstacles resulted in some participants drinking more during the pandemic than they had previously. As one participant articulated, “I think… because (alcohol use) was like less limited by other factors I think we were just drinking more than usual” (PM_15, 24-year-old non-Hispanic White female with moderate AUD symptomology). This sentiment was elaborated on by another participant who stated that: I didn’t have to go into the office. There wasn’t as much stuff going on, especially when they didn’t have like sports or anything. My kids have like three activities a day. So, to go from like 100% to like nothing, I was like “Wow, nothing else to do,” (PM_11, 37-year-old non-Hispanic, White female with mild AUD symptomology). Factors that normally served as deterrents to alcohol use (e.g., time constraints) tended to fall within two categories. The first was restrictions on participants’ ambulatory ability (e.g., “stay-at-home orders”; [46]) which led some participants to report drinking more than they normally would. For example, one participant said: I think I (drank) more often primarily. But as far as like quantities go too like again when you go out to the bars, you don’t want to get like super drunk because you want to make sure you make it home safe. I’ve always been super responsible about that. But if I’m already at home and I’m sleeping in the same place that I’m drinking, I feel really comfortable drinking more. And we had-- like my birthday that year we had like a-- we threw like a little disco. We got like a disco ball for our living room. And we got like a bunch of booze and we had maybe like six or seven people over and it was really fun. But like I said I could drink more because I’m at home, whereas the previous year we went out to eat or something like that. I don’t know. So it was definitely increased. (PM_15, 24-year-old non-Hispanic White female with moderate AUD symptomology) In this instance, the participant describes how pre-pandemic, they would use alcohol outside of their home in public settings (i.e., at bars). The need to safely return to their residence after using alcohol resulted in the subject moderating the amount of alcohol they would consume. Due to restrictions on public gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, this participant was unable to drink outside their home. This eliminated a pre-pandemic moderator of drinking behavior, resulting in the participant reporting using more alcohol. These sentiments were echoed by another participant who declared: “We were used to going out. So I think we still drink as much, but if not more, because now we’re home, we’re not out somewhere” (PM_06, 36-year-old Hispanic White female with severe AUD symptomology). In a similar vein, changes in work-related routines diminished the usual physical or social barriers participants would typically experience to using alcohol. For instance, due to unemployment or reductions in work obligations during the pandemic, participants experienced fewer obstacles to drinking. As one participant described: I was home. I couldn’t go to the gym. Work had basically ceased because no one could really do anything. I had my cell phone and now, I had-- all my friends like beer and drink or most of them do, a lot of my family does, and the guys at work that I work with are all really into beer. So, for those initial few weeks in March after lockdown, the reality was people were drinking beer at lunch and sending pictures of it around and I’m sitting on my couch at noon on my lunch break and I have no kids, no dependents. It’s just me and I’m like “That beer looks pretty good. I’m going to have a beer.” So, I started doing that and I wouldn’t say my drinking got crazy, but it was definitely more than what my average was… (CM_09, 51-year-old non-Hispanic White male with no AUD symptomology) The previous quote also showcases how social norms around drinking may have shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, due to a lack of work obligations, the participant and his colleagues began drinking during their lunch breaks and sharing pictures of their beer with each other, socially reinforcing their shared change in alcohol use. Another participant who described drinking during the pandemic stated: …everyone else was bored. So, [my friends would] be like “Oh, I’m going to come over and sit on the porch and drink with you,” and I’m like “Great. That’s what we’re going to do. Nothing else to do.” (PM_11, 37-year-old non-Hispanic, White female with severe AUD symptomology) In this case, the participant and their peers shared the experience of having fewer obligations and thus reported engaging in alcohol use. Even among participants whose work schedules were relatively unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions, changes in drinking behavior were apparent. For example, one participant said: …most of the time since I work from home I don’t have to leave except for going to get groceries and stuff, I just pretty much stayed here all the time drinking because there was no reason for me to leave... (PM_03, 27-year-old non-Hispanic Multiracial male with severe AUD symptomology) Similarly, another participant stated …it was easier just to start drinking while working at the house. There’s nobody there supervising me. So I got into that bad habit. I would be drinking while working from home… that was new for me since I would never drink and work at the same time. (CM_11, 33-year-old Hispanic White female with severe AUD symptomology) Taken together, these quotes suggest that for some participants working from home motivated an increase in alcohol use. This seems to have been due to the removal of previous drinking barriers including physical limitations (e.g., driving or travelling to bars). Additionally, it is evident that the social norms around alcohol use shifted because of social distancing measures such that, for example, drinking at certain times during the day became socially acceptable when previously it was not. In addition to these social barriers, there is evidence to suggest that changes to the availability of alcohol also facilitated reported increases in alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Theme 2: During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased availability of alcohol facilitated alcohol use Participants reported that the proliferation of options for purchasing alcohol made it easier for them to drink during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is, the environmental conditions dictating the degree to which the participants could get alcohol was a contributing factor to its use among participants. This availability could take on many forms. For example, numerous participants noted the expansions in local alcohol delivery including alcohol pick-up and to-go drink options. Respondents noted that they likely would not have utilized alcohol delivery pre-pandemic, but the convenience of this option was very appealing during the pandemic when social distancing measures were being promoted. For instance, one interaction between an interviewer and participant was as follows: Participant: Oh, yeah. My drinking was way worse during the pandemic than it is now. Interviewer: Yeah. How do you understand that? What’s contributed... Participant: Well, it was more available because I know here in [southwestern state], the Governor had approved for alcohol to be delivered to the house. Like, if you would order it over the phone, it could be delivered during COVID. So, I would utilize that sometimes. (CM_11, 33-year-old Hispanic White female with severe AUD symptomology) This is echoed by another participant exchange Interviewer: Was it easy or hard to get alcohol during the pandemic for you? Or was it about the same? Participant: It was easier. I mean, you have so many places, like, selling to go slushies in a bag from a bar. <laughs> Like, I mean, come on, now. (CM_07, 38-year-old non-Hispanic White female with moderate AUD symptomology) Still another participant reported But yeah, I think the easy access, you know, the to-go thing, the outdoor venues that you can drink outside it felt like kind of-- some of the previous boundaries have softened. It felt a bit more like Europe because I’m like-- we grow up and go in public transportation have drinks with us. That was normal or it still would be normal, but it feels strange. If I go back and I’ll go, like, what are you guys doing? What? (PM_12, 47-year-old non-Hispanic White male with mild AUD symptomology) These statements suggest that changes in alcohol availability (i.e., alcohol delivery and to-go policies) played a direct role in motivating alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. In these cases, the expansion of alcohol delivery and to-go policies facilitated alcohol use among participants. This seems to have been compounded by alcohol already being endemically prevalent. As one participant described: Interviewer: Why do you think it was alcohol and maybe not something else? Participant: …There’s a liquor store almost everywhere. There’s a beer store almost everywhere. It’s easy to get and you can even order it for delivery as well. So, I think that’s the reason why it became alcohol and nothing else and because it’s legal too. So, I can’t smoke weed because of all this other stuff, but I know a lot of folks who use substances like that, but alcohol just became something that was available and easy to get. (PM_02, 36-year-old non-Hispanic Black male with no AUD symptomology) In this example, the participant describes how since alcohol is legal and liquor stores are commonplace, it was easy for them to drink. This high availability of alcohol allowed participants to readily acquire alcohol and consume it. In addition, greater availability via the expansion of alcohol delivery services and to-go drinks from on-premises alcohol outlets led to participants having more options for alcohol availability which also supported alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Theme 3: During the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol became more easily accessible which fostered increased alcohol use Participants reported how the ease with which they could consume alcohol was a contributing factor to changes in their alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. This alcohol accessibility was defined as the environmental conditions dictating how quickly/easily the participant could consume alcohol. For example, always having beer in the house making alcohol immediately accessible. Participants reported that having alcohol in their homes was a contributing factor to their alcohol use. For example, one participant described: Yeah, no it changed like the convenience and right there. And it’s sort of-- I was looking for an outlet, and that was the easy hook for me. Okay, go to the fridge, get it. And I know over time if I’m looking at this, like I would start craving when is this thing over so I can go get this thing. (PM_02, 36-year-old non-Hispanic Black female with no AUD symptomology) For context, this participant was discussing how they utilized alcohol to minimize the stress they experienced from their job during the COIVID-19 pandemic. In this case, the immediate accessibility of alcohol facilitated them utilizing it as a stress reliever. When asked why they used alcohol instead of another strategy to relieve stress this participant went on to say “I don’t know. I think it’s because it was there, the power of suggestion”. Taken together these statements suggest that for some participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, the accessibility of alcohol facilitated its use as a stress reliever more so than before and in lieu of alternatives. Had there not been COVID-19 related restrictions (e.g., stay at home orders, social distancing measures) then this person may have reported using other means to relieve stress (e.g., going to the gym). Another participant said something similar: I think just like the accessibility of [alcohol], knowing like “Oh, let me just walk two feet, pour myself my own drink. There’s no bar tab that I can see,” and not having to like get up in the morning, get the kids to school or when they were in school, take them to school and then I could just go back home. I didn’t have to go into the office. There wasn’t as much stuff going on (PM_11, 37-year-old non-Hispanic White female with severe AUD symptomology) Another participant stated We can drink as much as we want. And I know the wine rack was always full during those early parts of the pandemic, which was great, but also, I definitely was drinking more. (PM_15, 24-year-old non-Hispanic White female with no AUD symptomology) The above quotes suggest that for these participants the fact that alcohol was readily accessible (i.e., it was in their houses) was a facilitator of their use of alcohol. Considering these participant statements, it becomes clear that alcohol accessibility had an impact on changes in alcohol use behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal factors Participants noted multiple personal reasons for drinking in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These included emotion-focused reasons, such as 1) coping with negative feelings that resulted from being unmoored and untethered from their everyday life due to the COVID-19 landscape; stress, anxiety, and emotional malaise; and boredom imposed by shelter-in-place; 2) the desire to experience positive emotion and pleasure in the context of ongoing deprivation; and 3) in order to celebrate (re)connections with loved ones and social events once social distancing restrictions began to ease. Theme 4: Participants described drinking to relax, unwind, and escape chronic negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic Participants described drinking alcohol to find relief from the negative affect resultant of the COVID-19 pandemic. Negative emotions experienced by participants included boredom (e.g., due to social gathering restrictions), stress due to changing work conditions during the pandemic, and social isolation. Participants described these negative emotions as the product of specific pandemic-related stressors (e.g., schooling children from home). For example, one participant stated: In many ways (drinking) was to relax. You know, being able to put the children to bed and think, okay, I’ve got at least an hour before somebody cries or something. I’m going got (sic) watch, you know, half an hour show. And then, you know, sit down on the couch and then… we would have that because we liked it, and then it would be in the fridge, and it would be so easy to just grab it and open it and go. And so it was an easeability (sic). It was, you know, what I would consider like a quick relaxation type of a situation. (PM_08, 31-year-old non-Hispanic White female with no AUD symptomology) In this case the participant described how alcohol was used to relax during the COVID-19 pandemic. For context, the participant had described earlier in the interview how changes in their job role and responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted their childcare. Additionally, the participant described how the accessibility of alcohol was what made it such an attractive option for stress relief. This accessibility seems to have been unique to the COVID-19 pandemic: no participants described using alcohol for relieving stress because it was always accessible prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, participants described an indefinable feeling of malaise/boredom during the pandemic. Often, participants described drinking to temporarily separate themselves from such feelings. Related to boredom specifically, one participant responded to a question about their reasons for drinking by saying, “I don’t know, I feel like a lot of drinking, especially during COVID, was just out of boredom, like being home and being bored” (PM_11, 37-year-old non-Hispanic White female with severe AUD symptomology). Another participant described her experience of increasing her drinking during the pandemic in the following way: I felt like I was on vacation, but it wasn’t a happy vacation…when I started drinking my heaviest I was just kind of like, well, I don’t have to go anywhere. Well, I don’t care. Well, I had a rough day. I’m going to do it. And so it was kind of like this like I’m in a really bad place…. I wasn’t like drinking a bottle of wine a day type of a situation, but I would have a beer while I was like unwinding watching a show at the end of the day. And I didn’t think about it at all. I just did it during that time. (PM_08, 31-year-old non-Hispanic White female with no AUD symptomology) She went on to note that drinking alcohol provided a way of creating a sense of perceived control during the pandemic, when she felt little control over the chronic stress in her life: Well, it definitely helped me to relax. I think on this weird level there was kind of like this feeling that I didn’t have control over anything… I can go to the liquor store, and I can pick out my own beer. And, you know, I got everything else taken out from under me, but I can do that. And then I can have a drink on a Monday night and nobody’s going to tell me I can’t. So it was bad, I think. (PM 08, 31-year-old non-Hispanic White female with no AUD symptomology) Other participants directly tied increases in their drinking to increases in stress at work, particularly among those who were essential workers and had to work in-person during the pandemic. One participant who worked in healthcare shared: I was noticeably drinking more and especially because things were stressful working in healthcare during those times. Our staffing was crummy…after a hard day you want a glass of wine with dinner to wind down and it wasn’t usually more than a glass or two, but it was like almost at--it was like five or six days a week. So if I opened a bottle last night and had two glasses, then the next day, I had to finish the bottle with another two glasses. And then it was kind of--it wasn’t like that every single week, but it was definitely more frequent and noticeable. (PM_15, 24-year-old non-Hispanic White female with moderate AUD symptomology) In these instances, participants described stressors associated with the pandemic, including feelings of being out of control, in tandem with decreased opportunities to regulate or escape their stressful contexts, as being associated with increases in their alcohol use. Some participants also tied their alcohol use during the pandemic to social isolation. As one participant described: I probably was drinking more during that time. I had a very strange schedule at work. I do work out in the environment, so there would be times where I would be just in a hotel room for a week by myself, so kind of a unique situation which probably culminated in I’m by myself more so I’m drinking, I don’t really have… I was alone a lot and there was really nothing to do where I was besides drink if that’s what I-- if I didn’t fall asleep right away. (CM_08 33-year-old non-Hispanic White female with mild AUD symptomology) This participant was in a unique position where their job required them to travel during the pandemic. However, due to social distancing measures they were essentially quarantined in their hotel room while not at their jobsite. This person described how this resulted in being socially isolated and thus drank more during the pandemic. Similarly, another participant described how …I want to say yeah, 2020, we at least-- well, of course, I was working at the bank and taking every precaution. Nobody there at work had-- it just seemed like it was very distant, you know, even though in [Southwestern City], the area was getting hit hard, it’s just in my circle of who I knew and where I was all the time, it just was very distant. So, Christmas season… it was just like total isolation and none of the regular stuff. So, I guess that would be the main stressor of it didn’t even really feel like Christmas because just... There was no family at any social-- when it came to family. …I guess [I was drinking] every weekend. (PM_01 30-year-old Hispanic male with mild AUD symptomology) In this instance, the participant describes how during the COVID-19 pandemic they experienced “total isolation”. This participant was socially isolated from their peers at work and was unable to spend the Christmas holidays with their family due to COVID-19. Concurrently they described their alcohol use as increasing. In both quotes above participants described how the social isolation resultant of the COIVD-19 pandemic was associated with changes in their alcohol use. Theme 5: Participants described drinking to experience positive emotions in a context with reduced opportunities for rewarding activities Some participants described using alcohol to provide themselves with a reward or to feel positive emotions in contexts of ongoing affective deprivation. Participants described the COVID-19 pandemic as an environment with diminished opportunities for reward, positive emotion, and pleasure. In that context, participants described using alcohol simply because they missed experiencing positive emotions and had few other ways to access pleasure. One participant shared: I think in a positive light, it’s been a way to feel like I can still have a treat…I can’t go out to restaurants, I can’t see friends, but it’s like you know what, I can have a glass of wine and I can watch a movie, and that is a nice way to feel like I’m taking care of myself…It’s just like it’s something nice I feel like I can do for myself that’s relatively low impact. (PM_13, 25-year-old non-Hispanic White female with no AUD symptomology). In a similar vein, a different participant stated the following: I think it’s purely a pleasure thing… not to get too graphic, but with COVID a girl that I was dating, we split up during COVID-19. She lives like 40 minutes for me. And I just-- you know, I wasn’t comfortable like going-- and she’s got kids and everything and so we dissolved that. So it-- there’s like less pleasure in my life now than there was pre-COVID. And one of the things that I can do is, you know, pour an [brand name] beer or, you know, a nice Oktoberfest and for that half hour or 45 minutes, I can, you know, I can enjoy it. (CM_09, 51-year-old non-Hispanic White male with no AUD symptomology) In this instance the participant describes how the COVID-19 resulted in a “lack of pleasure” in their life. This participant’s romantic relationship ended due to the pandemic and previously in the interview they had described how social gathering restrictions had resulted in a lack of alternative means of stimulation (e.g., not being able to go to the gym). As such, for this person alcohol became a source of positive reinforcement. Another participant also specifically described drinking to reward himself for getting through the work week or as a reward after working out, saying “During COVID, the beer became a primary focus. I sat on my couch and really focused on every sip because it was a sensual experience that I wasn’t getting anywhere else.” (CM_06, 54-year-old non-Hispanic White male with no AUD symptomology). In these examples, participants describe alcohol as creating a positive emotional and sensory experience, and as a way of being able to access pleasure and positive emotion. Theme 6: As pandemic lockdowns began to lift, participants described drinking more heavily during social events and drinking alcohol to celebrate (renewed) ability to spend time with friends and family Multiple participants noted that the easing of COVID-19 related social distancing measures motivated heavy alcohol use. Specifically, as they began to re-engage with friends and family whom they had not been able to connect with during the pandemic they drank more during these social interactions than they had pre-pandemic. Participants described how due to overall feelings of deprivation during the COVID-19 pandemic, social events that were normative pre-pandemic felt particularly celebratory. As a result, they reported drinking more in these circumstances than previously. As one participant noted: …I think we celebrated bigger, like all in celebrate. So, yeah, I would say that happened, like, because now there’s always a reason to celebrate, which is cool, and we always are good-- we love a good celebration. But it felt like, ooh, we can really celebrate this time. We can be somewhere. We can do something about how we feel about this thing and so, yeah, we went in hard for the celebrations that were-- that we could do. So it was cool. It was cool to me because it’s like, “Yeah, I get to celebrate and everybody is celebrating and we’re all enjoying it.” And I think it just kind of threw more into it because we couldn’t celebrate for so long. And then now that I can celebrate, like, yeah, let’s really get it in. (CM_01, 44-year-old Hispanic Black female with no AUD symptomology) Another participant said So, here again, it’s always about having a good time, the celebrating of something. You make up “Okay, we’re going to celebrate the fact that I haven’t seen you since last year,” just the celebrating of the whole deal when you got together. (CM_03, 66-year-old non-Hispanic Black female with moderate AUD symptomology) Whereas prior to the pandemic, celebratory drinking was described as related to significant milestones (e.g., getting a new job or getting married), in 2021 and later, spending time with loved ones, even casually, was described as an event to celebrate, and alcohol use during such gatherings was much more like (heavier) drinking patterns associated with special occasions, as opposed to light to moderate social drinking. Discussion Results of this qualitative study suggest that participants’ self-reported alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic was motivated by a confluence of both contextual and individual factors. Changes to social and environmental factors resulted in decreased barriers to alcohol use, increased alcohol availability and increased accessibility, all of which facilitated drinking. This finding corroborates quantitative studies suggesting that policies increasing the availability of alcohol during the pandemic were directly related to elevated drinking [47,48]. During the pandemic, social distancing measures were enacted [49] which vastly restricted what people could do and where they could go, resulting in many people being homebound. For some participants this confinement seems to have lessened barriers to alcohol use, that is, alcohol was seen as one of the few easily available options to reduce negative feelings and/or boredom. Furthermore, social distancing and quarantine measures effectively eliminated typical drinking contexts for many people. Since social gatherings were not permitted and obligations that typically deter alcohol use, such as driving children to activities, were removed it became unclear when alcohol could or should be used. Concurrently, one participant believed that their peers used alcohol during the day (e.g., during work hours) and that such behavior was socially acceptable within the context of the pandemic. This participant described a lack of work obligations resulting in him and his colleagues drinking during their lunch breaks and sharing pictures of their beer with each other, socially reinforcing their shared change in alcohol use. In another instance, a participant described drinking because they and their friends had “nothing else to do”. It could be inferred that these participants’ alcohol use was socially reinforced by their peers. That is, the participant and their peers shared the experience of their alcohol use increasing due to boredom which was resultant of a reduction of other obligations. It is unclear why this social reinforcement occurred, but it could have been a strategy to mitigate feelings of shame around increased alcohol use. Presumably drinking during the day (e.g., during work hours) would not have been acceptable pre-pandemic. The participant and his colleagues who shared pictures of their beers may have done so as a way of validating their behavior- they may have been reassured that their behavior was not unusual given their peers were also drinking during the workday. This was not a common theme in the present analysis and should be explored in future work. The confluence of free time and changes in descriptive and injunctive drinking norms resulted in some participants reporting using alcohol at times when they would not normally do so (e.g., during the workday). Such findings are corroborated by research showing that changes in descriptive norms around alcohol use (e.g., increase in perceived norms for drinks per week) was associated with self-reported increases in drinking during the pandemic [50,51]. Being secluded at home further facilitated alcohol use due to the removal of safety concerns (e.g., having to drive home while intoxicated) and accessibility of alcohol in the home. Additional to the erasure of social barriers, the social isolation experienced by participants during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major shifts in participants’ affective states. Participants described how throughout the pandemic they felt persistent negative emotions including boredom and anxiety. Concurrently participants experienced a diminishment in the availability of positively emotionally valanced activities (e.g., socialization/recreation). The compounding impact of the simultaneous increase in negative affect and decreased access to reinforcing behaviors resulted in a perceptible shift in how alcohol was viewed and used among participants. During the pandemic alcohol became a “primary focus” where alcohol itself was viewed as a “treat” or something to look forward to. For some alcohol became an affective regulation strategy, where drinking was a means to both dispel negative emotions and increase positive feelings. This may help contextualize research demonstrating an association between depressive symptoms and alcohol use observed during the COVID-19 pandemic [52,53]. Changes in the availability and accessibility of alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic further impacted self-reported alcohol use among participants. As participants described, several states saw an expansion of alcohol delivery policies. For example, in some states, liquor stores, restaurants and bars were allowed for the first time to deliver alcohol to people’s residences [5,48]. This led to alcohol being easier to get and importantly did not require people to physically leave their homes. Evidence shows that people who said they used alcohol home delivery services during the pandemic consumed more alcohol and reported more drinking days and consumed larger volumes of alcohol at home than people who accessed alcohol by other means. As a result of this increased availability, participants described how their access to alcohol dramatically increased resulting in participants having alcohol continuously at home. This coupled with the social isolation and lack of typical alcohol use social cues likely further motivated increased alcohol use during the pandemic. One participant mentioned how this increase in alcohol availability “softened” boundaries around alcohol use. This echoes statements made by other participants suggesting how changes in social context removed barriers to alcohol use. The increased ubiquity of alcohol seems to have resulted in a lowering of social constraints on alcohol use. That is, by increasing the availability of alcohol (i.e., to-go drinks, outdoor drinking venues) the participant perceived its use to be more socially acceptable. However, this sentiment was only shared by a single participant, so it is unclear the extent to which alcohol availability may have shifted social norms and thereby impacted alcohol use. Future research could further explore this topic. Our results also suggest that the increases in alcohol use reported by participants continued after social distancing measures began to be lifted. As the restrictions originally imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 eased, many participants described drinking alcohol to celebrate being able to (re)connect with loved ones and noted that social interactions that were previously part of everyday life felt like special occasions that deserved to be celebrated in the wake of long-term isolation. Alcohol use during such gatherings was described as more intense than pre-pandemic (i.e., participants engaged in heavy drinking). It can be inferred that this surge in alcohol use was due to participants wanting to enhance the positive experience of such events. It is also possible that this increased celebratory drinking may have been the result of their increased alcohol use during the pandemic (e.g., increased alcohol tolerance). These qualitative reports of desires for celebratory drinking upon easing of social distancing measures are consistent with per capita alcohol consumption estimates that continued to rise through 2021, where a 2.9% increase from 2020 was observed [10]. However, per capita alcohol consumption decreased in 2022, down 1.2% from 2021, suggesting that perhaps motivations to drink heavily to celebrate in-person social interactions did not persist, although more research is needed to establish the accuracy of this suggestion. Our analyses focused on the contextual and individual level forces that motivated participants’ self-reported increased alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is currently unknown what the long-term impacts of elevated pandemic-era alcohol use may be. It is plausible that this elevated substance use will have health consequences for many in the long-term. Indeed, some participants from our study discussed that they experienced health issues resultant from their increased use, including substance use disorder relapses, anxiety, and gastrointestinal distress. However, such accounts were anecdotal and did not reach saturation during thematic analysis. There is a need to further investigate the long-term impacts of increased alcohol use during the pandemic as we continue to move beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations The present study has limitations which must be acknowledged when considering our findings. First, the present sample was derived from the NAS-C19 sample and was limited to those who reported drinking above NIAAA guidelines. As such, our findings may not be generalizable to the overall U.S. population. Although Wave 1 sampling procedures were designed to recruit a representative sample of the U.S. population, all participants were individuals who participated in all three waves of data collection and are likely different from the general population. In addition, our sample was majority non-Hispanic White, limiting our ability to draw inferences about how other racial and ethnic groups’ alcohol use motivations and behaviors were impacted. This is especially important given that the Black Lives Matter movement occurred concurrently with the COVID-19 pandemic [54]. That is, the higher baseline stress described by our participants may have been even more severe among individuals from ethnic/racially minoritized groups who experienced both COVID-19 related stressors and increased saliency of racial marginalization. Research somewhat supports this claim, with evidence suggesting that alcohol use increased among individuals from ethnic/racially minoritized groups during the pandemic [14,55]. In addition, just over half of our participants self-identified as essential workers, but we did not collect data on participants’ specific occupations. As such we can only make limited inferences on how alcohol use may have been impacted among different types of essential workers (e.g., healthcare workers). However, regardless of occupation, it is likely given the high levels of stress and psychological trauma reported by essential workers [56] that their alcohol use was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic [57]. The present work is also limited due to a lack of saturation of several topics germane to alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, one participant described how their reported alcohol use may have been a way for them to exert control during a time when their autonomy was limited. This was only expressed by a single participant, but such behavior may have been experienced by others. Similarly, one participant implied that increased alcohol availability impacted perceived social norms around alcohol use. However, this was the only time this topic arose-- we have no other analogous participant statements in our dataset. Since this topic never reached saturation, we cannot draw conclusions about how social forces and alcohol availability interacted to impact behavior. Further research is needed to explore these topics. Another limitation is that our ability to make inferences about potential mechanisms of or reasons for changes in alcohol use is limited by what was salient to participants at the time of the interviews. For example, besides the expansion of alcohol delivery services (e.g., to-go drinks) there were likely other factors which changed availability (e.g., increased demand for alcohol during the pandemic). However, since participants did not discuss other changes in alcohol availability, we can only guess as to what those were. In a similar way, although some participants discussed their employment arrangements during COVID-19 and its association with their alcohol use, this was not a focus of the interviews. As such we have limited data on participants’ COVID-19 work arrangements and how such arrangements may have impacted their alcohol use. It is also important to note that the present study, like all retrospective research, relied on participants to provide post hoc explanations for their behavior. Relying on retrospective data presents certain limitations which impacts what can be inferred from the data due to a lack of accuracy. Research suggests that alcohol use self-report accuracy diminishes over time [58,59] and that retrospective estimates of substance use may be more representative of participants’ current use at the time of assessment rather than of the time in question [60,61]. There is also evidence that the accuracy of self-reported alcohol use diminishes when participants engage in heavy/binge alcohol use [62]. In addition, other research suggests that participants’ current emotional states [63] and social desirability [64] influences retrospective reporting of past events (e.g., alcohol use). Therefore, participants attributing their increased alcohol use to negative affect may be inaccurate. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the accuracy of participants’ accounts of alcohol use and their potential motivations to use alcohol may have been inaccurate. However, it should be noted that all participants in the current study reported drinking above NIAAA guidelines during wave 2 of the NAS-C19 study. That is, these participants’ retrospective accounts of increased alcohol use during the interviews were corroborated by their own data collected from during the pandemic. Given that the NAS-C19 survey was also retrospective (it asked about alcohol use over the past several months) it is still possible that these data may lack accuracy. Nevertheless, this corroboration increases our confidence that at the very least participants’ recollections about the changes in the general patterns of alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic were accurate. A second limitation of relying on retrospective reports is it precludes us from making comparisons across time points. That is, our qualitative interviews are cross-sectional retrospective data, therefore this makes it challenging to discern how behaviors differed before and during the pandemic. Although we explicitly asked participants to describe how they perceived their alcohol use motivations were impacted by the pandemic, as described above, said reports may have been inaccurate. Given we do not have a means to more objectively compare drinking motivation across time points limits our ability to confidently state how the pandemic impacted alcohol use motivation. Conclusions The current study provides evidence for how the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted motives to use alcohol among a sample of U.S.-based alcohol using adults. Through qualitative analysis of participants’ accounts we determined that both contextual and individual level forces interacted to shape participants’ self-reported alcohol use during this time. Contextual factors including reduced barriers to alcohol use (e.g., changes in work schedules), and increases in both alcohol availability (e.g., legalization of alcohol delivery) and accessibility (e.g., being homebound where alcohol was present) facilitated elevated drinking during the pandemic. These factors helped catalyze participants’ individual reasons for drinking including drinking as a means of emotional regulation (e.g., to manage chronic boredom resultant of being confined to their home). These findings help to frame quantitative research showing elevated alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date research has focused on either environmental (e.g., expansion of alcohol home delivery; [5,48]) or individual (e.g., negative affect; [65]) level factors’ impact on pandemic era drinking separately. Our research contributes to the field by examining these concurrently and explored how these forces interacted together to influence participants’ motivations to use alcohol in a global pandemic. This adds to the field of public health and offers insights into how to mitigate future increases in substance use post-disasters. Findings suggest it is inadvisable to increase alcohol availability and accessibility in a global crisis rife with fear, boredom and isolation if increases in alcohol use and related harms are to be averted. Further, given the potential for changes in social norms around alcohol use during a global crisis as we observed here, social norms campaigns [66] leveraging normative messaging highlighting that not everyone is engaging in increased or heavy alcohol use may help reduce the impact of more permissive drinking norms. Future research is needed to investigate the long-term impacts of pandemic era changes in alcohol use, and it is vitally important for future investigations to examine how such impacts may manifest differently across different subgroups of the U.S. population.

This tool offers a new way to assess navigation and seafaring abilities in prehistory while also enabling the direct comparison between different type vessels and vessel configuration, navigational skills and propulsion. Results are filtered using certain limitations on safety (wind strength, wave height, light etc.) and navigational error. The method is here used to compare direct open water (c. 110 km) and coast hugging (c. 700 km) voyages between Jutland and south-west Norway in the Early Nordic Bronze Age, two areas that were closely connected from the Late Neolithic throughout the Bronze Age (c. 2350-1500 BC). Simulated results suggest that although the longer coastal route is usable all year round, direct open sea voyages, which included navigation out-of-sight-of-land for up to 50 km, were most likely undertaken. Such voyages would have necessitated boats capable of withstanding and maintaining directional control in ≤ 1 m waves and winds of up to 10 knots (5 m/s) at a minimum. Furthermore, these simulations highlight the comparable advantage of sail over paddling for transporting cargo over long distances (journeys of more than one days length).

Introduction Boats and maritime technology play a pivotal role in the movement of peoples, ideas, goods and technology in prehistoric societies. This becomes apparent in instances where cultural traits such as metal artefacts, iconography and, increasingly, ancient DNA belonging to the same group of people are found on land on opposite sides of large stretches of open water [1]. For instance, the Nordic Bronze Age societies exchanged metals over great distances with up to one tonne imported from the British Isles alone during a period from around 1600 to 1500 BC, something which would have provided an impetus for the development of boat technologies [2,3]. Recent research stresses the expansive dynamism of the Nordic Bronze Age groups because of their ability to organize, and capitalize on, a complex Maritime Mode of Production (MMP) [2]. The MMP included political strategies to control trading and raiding through owning boats and financing long distance maritime expeditions. These expeditions would actively seek out the sources of, e.g., metals, and thereby effectively cut out any expensive middlemen and lower-level transactions as well as potentially hostile encounters in the process [2,4]. Yet, the boats, the navigational skills and the actual sea routes that undoubtedly underpinned such occurrences remain elusive and the complex systems integrating these activities are most often illustrated merely by the addition of large arrows on a map. Simulations of seafaring voyages as method to understand maritime mobility in prehistory were first developed in the 1970s with a view to exploring whether the Polynesian expansion could have happened by chance, that is, through passive voyages where boats were simply drifting with winds and currents [5]. More recent simulations focus on passive drift scenarios, sea journeys based on very rough estimates of paddling speed, or the simulation of historical voyages where there are detailed diaries of passage and course [6–13]. Other efforts to isolate some of the multiple variables needed to understand prehistoric seafaring, include the application of least cost models, where winds, currents and topography information is used to generate routes that minimize traveling “costs”, such as duration or risk [14, 15]. Meanwhile, there have been enormous improvements in digital hardware and software as well as in the resolution of the wind, currents, and other environmental data simulations are dependent on. For example, there are several ocean voyaging optimization software products on the market developed for use within the commercial shipping industry and amongst the boat racing community (see for example DECARTES & ADRENA). Attempts to apply aspects of such optimization models, using, e.g., weather routing linked to land visibility and the detection of specific landmarks, has also recently been used as a way to explore prehistoric sea routes [16]. However, none of these applications allow for agency, which is seafarers making active choices based on specific conditions and their knowledge of their boat. For this, reliable boat performance data is needed [7]. The aim of this paper is to present a way to use ocean voyage modelling together with high resolution performance data of a reconstruction of the 350 BC Hjortspring boat, here referred to as a Bronze Age (BA) type boat [17], to go beyond large arrows on a map and try to gain an understanding of the nature of prehistoric sea crossings, limiting factors for different types of crossings while considering aspects of safety and seafaring abilities built up over centuries. As a case study, we are going to simulate and compare sea journeys between the region of Thy in northern Jutland, Denmark, and the region of Lista, in southwestern Norway (Fig 1), two non-tidal areas that are seemingly divided by over 100 kilometres of open Skagerrak waters, yet, for which the archaeological evidence suggest regular and close contact from the Late Neolithic period into the Bronze Age [19].

From the Oslo fjord area, the onward sea journey follows the coast to the west, using islands, natural bays and harbours for shelter on the final leg to Lista. The main questions we seek to answer with these simulations are: Archaeological background The area of Thy is situated in northern Jutland, Denmark, on the northern shores of the sheltered inland waterways afforded by the Limfjord and with the exposed sandy seashores of the Skagerrak to the north (Fig 2). The strategic location on the Limfjord, which offered a relatively safe and sheltered east-westerly seafaring route, connecting the North Sea with the Baltic Sea up until its western entrance silted up in the Middle Ages [21], no doubt helped ensure its position as centre of wealth and power from the Late Neolithic period into the Bronze Age [22, 23]. 1500 BC paleogeographic map of the area.

The peninsula has in historical times been of great strategic importance both as a protective harbour and portage route for sailing ships, but also as a control point during the German occupation during World War II. From prehistory, the region is recognised by a material assembly and architectonic expression that is closely connected with that of Jutland, specifically from the Late Neolithic and onward. This resemblance has been pointed out by several researchers over the years [19,24–28]. Already in 1869 [29], Worsaae pointed to a similar material expression between Jutland and the southwestern part of Norway, and later in 1877 Anders Lorange surveyed many of the Bronze Age mounds at Lista [30]. Above all, it is the large amounts of type I flint daggers, introduced at the beginning of the Late Neolithic that show strong ties with Jutland [31]. An estimated 10 percent of all type I daggers in Scandinavia can be found along the coast of Norway [31]. In part, these daggers along with other beaker elements such as wrist guards, flint sickles, tanged and barbed arrowheads, and small composite mound burials have been connected to groups in the Limfjord region [32, 33]. The emergence of this material assembly is strongly connected to a western oriented coastal route that seems to begin in the Lista region and stretches all along the western coast to Nordland [34]. Following the archaeological objects is also a new socioeconomic shift with the emergence of two-aisled longhouses and agropastoral subsistence economy that would come to define the following Bronze Age [35]. For all this to have been possible a new maritime technology must have been a prerequisite, and several researchers connect this material and socioeconomic change with the first planked-built vessels, the preludes to the Hjortspring boat [19,36,37]. The initial introduction of this socioeconomic package is later followed by the first metal finds in Norway, nearly all with a western oriented distribution [38]. Several of the early metal objects are located on the small peninsula of Lista [39]. This includes a Late Neolithic noppenringe from the continent, an early tin awl and later tin-alloyed bronze objects dated to Early Bronze Age Period I with origins to the continent [4,39]. Metal objects accumulate during the Bronze Age proper, between c. 1500–900 BC, many of which are discovered within monumental earthen barrows and cairns that are clearly visible from the seaway. The constructional choice of burying the dead in earthen barrows (limited to southwestern Norway) is closely tied to South Scandinavian practices and a sign of wealth and power, most likely accumulated due to Lista’s strategic location as a bottleneck ([40] for a discussion on the concept). As emphasised by Prescott et al., it is highly likely that the peninsula of Lista is strategically advantageous due its natural harbours and portages [34]. It would also lend itself as a natural resting place after crossing the Skagerrak strait and function as a staging ground for travels further up the coast or south to Jutland. The strong connections between Thy and Lista in the Bronze Age is thus evidenced by the presence of imported lithics and metal artifacts from the Limfjord region, as well as notable similarities in burial practices in earthen mounds, cists made of stone slabs and similar architectural styles seen in three-aisled longhouses [4]. This similarity continuous west and northwards along the Norwegian coast. In contrast, when facing eastwards from the Lista peninsula the material and architectonic similarities are less clear. Burials are here instead mainly built with stones instead of earth (so called stone cairns), which appear in the thousands along the paleogeographic archipelagos of southern Norway and western Sweden, the majority of which are believed to date to the early Bronze Age [41]. An otherwise denominative feature for all southern Scandinavia is the rock art which appears in clusters along these coastal waterways and which date to c. 1700 – 200 BC. The maritime location of this imagery is further emphasized by its predominant focus on boats [3,42,43]. Bohuslän, placed roughly halfway along the coastal route between Lista and Thy, is the richest rock art area in Europe and in Scandinavia, featuring over 10,000 boat images, and is believed to have been an important boatbuilding and transit area in the Bronze Age [44]. Relatively large concentrations of flint and sickle daggers as well as bronzes found in this region points towards significant and often intense communication with the Jutland also for this region from the late Neolithic and throughout the Bronze Age [20,31]. Thus, whereas rock art and general artefacts point towards the possibility that the two regions of Thy and Lista might have been communicating via the coastal route, the very specific similarities in certain types of materials and architectonic expressions might suggest the coastal route was bypassed altogether. So far, no studies have quantitatively modelled maritime travels using either route. Frode Kvalø [24] has done a thorough study on the possibilities of the direct routes across the Kattegat Strait based on oceanographic, ethnographic and experimental data; whereas, Bengtsson [20,43] instead has focused on potential seafaring routes between Bohuslän and Jutland, identifying the relative safety afforded to small open boats operating within archipelagos or along lee coast in relation to the direction and strength of the wind. However, there are now several new methodological and computational considerations that need to be evaluated, and which might help shed new light on the nature of maritime communication between the two regions in the Bronze Age. The sea routes – navigational aspects and considerations In addition to Kvalø [24], direct routes between northern Denmark to southern Norway have been proposed by Marstrander [45], Johansen [46] and Østmo [19] with the three suggesting Hanstholm on the north-western point of Thy as the most likely departure point (Fig 2). The Hanstholm Knude, a 9 x 2 kilometres large chalk ridge that rises to a height of over 60 meters above the present-day sea level, provides a striking point of reference within the landscape, and an equally important point of reference for seafarers (Fig 3) [23].

For this reason, a stray find of a flanged axe (Fig 3.) dated to c. 1950–1700 BC in the northern part of Bjerre Enge is of interest, since it indicates that already at this early period the area was visited, when potentially the axe was dropped from a boat [23]. Whether this Littorina Sea in any way connected the Hanstholm area with the Limfjord area to the south remains uncertain, not least since erosion rates in the area are high (Fig 4). This uncertainty makes it imperative to consider the possibility that a seafarer intent on reaching Hanstholm from the Limfjord might have had to follow the unprotected west coast of Thy for some 50 kilometres (Fig 2). Present day erosion rates along this coast indicate that up to 5 kilometres of land has been lost since the Bronze Age [23]. This makes it difficult to assess the availability of natural landing places along this route, perhaps afforded by small river inlets, or whether boats would have had to rely on being able to make the trip in one go or otherwise be dragged up on the beach well in advance of any bad weather fronts. Because of these uncertainties, we will focus on a slightly longer direct crossing straight from the mouth of the eastern entry to the Limfjord, as it is within the sheltered waters of the Limfjord that we find the main thrust of human occupation for this period as well as a multitude of potential landing sites near Early Bronze Age houses (Fig 3). ) elevation curve (after [4]).

If first following the coast up to Hanstholm, the direct crossing over open sea would be reduced to about 110 km in a north-north-westerly direction before landfall amongst the outer islands off the coast somewhere between Flekkerøy to the east and Skjernøya. However, if the weather was clear enough and the crew could manage it, it might aim straight for the Lindesnes promontory, which with its height of over 100 meters to this day afford a distinct coastal landmark to seafarers whilst at the same time offering a multitude of inlets that could provide shelter for a boat with limited draught [51] (Fig 4). There are several scenarios when, primarily during the summer months when cloudiness and instances of mist are at a minimum [52], a direct crossing might have been feasible from either the Limfjord or Hanstholm, even in a relatively small boat using only very basic methods for navigation [53, 54]. Any crossing party would firstly lie in wait of favourable weather conditions, most likely guided by the reassurance of one or more consecutive red evening skies [51]. The red evening sky phenomenon is caused by the trapping of dust and particles in the atmosphere by high pressure [55]. This causes blue light to scatter, leaving the red light to colour the sky [55]. In regions such as Scandinavia, where weather systems tend to come from the west, this is a reliable indicator of the arrival of a high-pressure front bringing with it fair weather for that night and the following day, perhaps even longer depending on how big the system is and how quickly it is moving. Thus, waiting for this phenomenon would be a good way to establish a relatively safe time of departure and would usually ensure a reliable morning breeze to help push the boat for the first 10 kilometres or so before petering out, but seafarers could equally wait for southerly winds to establish and depart hoping these will stay put for the duration of the trip. In whichever case, the crossing could hypothetically be initiated at any time from sunset. In southern Scandinavia, twilight remain throughout the night in the months between late May until late July, whence the centre of the sun stays within 12 degrees below the horizon after sunset. During these months the sun sets in the NW and rises in the NE and the direction of the suns passage remain noticeable as a faint light across the horizon. After sunset there is almost an hour of good light (civil light), followed by a 3–4-hour long period of nautical light during which time the horizon is visible as well as the strongest stars [56, 57]. This should make it possible to navigate northwards on the sun on a clear night, in open sea with no obstacles, but would not be sufficient for safely navigating within an archipelago. During darker nights, stars could potentially have provided basic guidance of direction at sea. The celestial north pole in 1500 BC was not marked by the current polar star, the Polaris, but the relative positions of stars around this point could have been used to determine a general direction of the north (compare with [58–60]). If not navigating at night, any crossing initiated from an hour before sunrise would be limited by the hours of light which range between 19 or 20 hours in the summer months to only 15 to 16 hours in April or October and barely eight during the darkest days of the year close to the winter solstice in late December. Once the sun rises above the horizon it continues its use as a point of reference. Heading in a northerly direction it would be comparatively easy to keep track of its semicircular path across the sky, in comparison with the horizon or the rail of the boat and the wind or wave direction, in the knowledge that at its zenith, it appears to stand still for four minutes before continuing in a semicircular descendent [61]. Thus, during the months of the year with abundant sunlight, navigation would have been conducted primarily by the position of the sun. Other important points of reference would be the temperature, smell, salinity and colour of the sea and the direction and nature of the swells and/or waves when travelling across the Skagerrak, and even the sightings and flight paths of birds, perhaps in relation to known nesting cliffs [58]. The variation of the depth across the route would most probably have effect on the type of waves/swell and the colour of the sea, in addition to which currents carrying water that is warmer or less salty might be another point of reference, all of which a seasoned seafarer would have been observant of [58]. Between Jutland and southern Norway there are several very distinct “bands” of depth along the route, ranging from relatively shallow water on the first half, but including one section of water depth below 100 m, whereas the second half is characterised by depths of more than 200 m, before reaching the last band around 15 kilometres before landfall when water depths decrease to around 20-50 m (Fig 2). Another important navigational aid are clouds [51]. The most important of these are the cauliflower shaped formations of cumulus clouds that usually form over land on fair-weather days once the sea breeze fills in from the early afternoon [20,51]. On a clear day such clouds can be seen over the relatively low-lying Jutland from over 70 kilometres (Figs 5 and 9). However, on particularly hot summers days, clouds might not form, in addition to which the sight conditions are generally less clear, impairing the sighting of land from the sea even further. The distance from here to Denmark is c. 70 geoidal km and the wind speed at the time 4-5 m/s (photo: Boel Bengtsson, July 2020 at a height of c. 4 m.a.s.l.).

Generally, the slower the boat the larger the drift. In a paddled boat, leeway will have to be countered by increasing the paddling effort on the leeward side or by reducing paddling effort on the windward side.

Note: None of the original elevation data is displayed. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g008 On a clear day, on the basis that the southern Norwegian coast features mountains with peaks in the region of 300 to over 600 meters height, this coast should be within sighting distance from the sea at around 35-45 kilometres before landfall even without a cloud cover [62]. That should allow a navigator to adjust the course towards the western part of whatever land is visible. Once a particular landmark such as the Lindisnæs promontory has been identified, potentially once the vessel is within around 24 kilometres, further adjustments to the course can be made (Fig 6). In the opposite direction, land is much harder to detect from a distance unless cloud formations have developed, depending on which Hanstholm (or Bulbjerg) might not be detected until a vessel has come within a radius of c. 20 km (Fig 6). Thus, a small vessel setting off from Jutland might expect to be out of sight of land after c. 20 km (but could potentially detect land behind if/once clouds have developed towards the afternoon), whereafter it would have to proceed using a combination of navigational aids provided by primarily the positioning of the sun and the direction of the swell, in combination with a sound knowledge of the boat and how it is affected by wind and waves (Fig 7) [53]. In clear weather the total length of open water navigation without sight of land in any direction is approximately 50 kilometres if no clouds have formed over land. On clear weather days where clouds do form over the high mountains of southern Norway, this distance might be greatly reduced (Fig 8) [55]. While allowing for reduced visibility, a lack of thermal cloud formations, and variable wind and sea conditions, navigational error (Fig 9), or expected radius of arrival in relation to the intended destination, might be in the region of 25 degrees. Ultimately, the success of this long open water journey would be down to a combination of skills including that of weather prediction and navigation, seamanship and the type and speed of vessel used [43]. The longer land hugging, or coastal “highway” route [20] suggested in this paper, which is a combination of mainly inland and coastal waterways with only two or three relatively short direct open-water crossings of up to 45 km length, is almost 600 kilometres longer than a direct route (Fig 10). From an environmental perspective, not considering any potential dangers or “costs” caused by social interactions, this route has three main advantages in comparison to a direct Skagerrak crossing. Firstly, both the inland waterways of the Limfjord, the lee-coast of eastern Jutland and the archipelago that proceeds northwards from around the height of Onsala on the Swedish west coast from where it continues more or less all the way to Lista, provide a buffering effect on the amplitude of waves that can build up (see shaded areas along the sea route in Figs 1 and 10), the perhaps most important factor to consider when operating a small paddled (or oared) vessel (in addition to wind strength). Wave height is commonly used to categorize commercial shipping zones for inland and coastal waterways (Table 1) and are based on the conditions of the main thoroughfares suitable for larger vessels but can be adopted to describe the significance the buffering effect has on small craft seafaring (Fig 11). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.t001 To a certain degree this buffering effect also applies to the average wind speed [64, 65] and would suggest windows of operation within a buffer zone, in particular for a vessel with a low draught, are much wider in comparison to areas outside this buffer zone where the maximum significant wave height is much higher (Fig 11). Secondly, if excluding the shorter direct crossings, both the inland route through the Limfjord and the archipelagos offer not only a multitude of resting places along the route for a crew to recoup or await favourable conditions, but also a wider choice of routes to pick depending on the prevailing sea state and weather conditions. Thus, routes deep within the archipelago, nearest to the coast proper might have been chosen on windy days, avoiding any stretches of more open water, whereas portages might have been used to avoid particularly difficult stretches of coast (e.g., Lista). Portages could also have been used as short cuts across large headlands as and when needed (e.g., between Brastad and Kville – see B in Fig 10). Ancient place names indicate locations where portaging was common practice and several rock art sites dating to the Bronze Age are located near such potential portage routes, a connection further emphasised by imagery appearing to depict boats that were carried or even pulled by animals across land [3,42,66]. Thirdly, a coast hugging route makes navigation easier since land is always within sight. Although the archipelago appears deceptively difficult to navigate for an outsider, knowledge about land formations, the ability to distinguish a headland from islands or which islands provide fresh water or safe havens, and the nature and location of hazards would most certainly be handed down and shared through the generations, in a similar way in which we today might provide instructions to a car driver (who does not have a GPS, map or a phone) (compare with [66, 67]). Whereas the many Bronze Age stone cairns that scatter the islands in the archipelagos along the route might have provided points of reference when navigating these waters depending on whether they were originally visible from the sea; they certainly provide an appreciation of which regular routes seafarers were using [43,66]. Using such knowledge in combination with what is the most basic repertoire for any navigator – the use of thumbs, hands and arms to judge distance and course, and transit lines for entering or leaving particularly tricky areas - would have been enough to safely navigate these waters in the type of shallow drafted boats we believe were used in the Bronze Age [17,53,68]. As for the shorter direct routes within the longer coast hugging route, we suggest crossings might have been attempted taking advantage of the large shallow areas created by the Littorina Sea, at a juxtaposition of roughly 20 km from Jutland and perhaps 45 km from Onsala on the Swedish west coast, and from which the island of Læsø has formed (A in Fig 10). The oldest part of Læsø emerged as a c. 10 km long sand barrier spit around 2900 BC and appears to have remained similar in size until c. AD 1000 when it merged with a second raised sand barrier system[69]. High erosion rates make it difficult to confirm the exact configuration of the island in the intermediate periods but the presence of raised boulder reefs in the vicinity, and now submerged reefs marked out further to the north of Læsø on old maps [70], as well as the established merging of two separate spit islands to form the present shape of the island, would suggest spit islands might have appeared and disappeared throughout the intervening years without necessarily leaving any trace. This could explain why only archaeological remains related to Pitted Ware groups have been found on this oldest part of the island [71], whereas a lack of Bronze Age material might result from a change in the landscape and the loss of any landing sites used in the Bronze Age [66]. Whichever the case, these shallow waters would have ensured low wave amplitudes within the area, a perfect choice of route for shallow drafted vessels [20,43]. Thus, this longer land hugging route offers navigational challenges of a slightly different nature compared to the direct crossing of the Kattegat, in that it is not a “leap of faith” to same degree, and, although the same level of weather prediction/navigational skills and seamanship applies, the journey is not quite as dependant on the long window of “perfect” weather conditions in terms of waves and wind for other than much shorter periods. Therefore, on fair weather days, heralded by a red evening sky the previous evening, the crew can use the light winds in the morning for a more direct route while seeking more sheltered routes for the afternoon once the sea breeze has filled in, and which can often reach peaks of 8-10 m/s in the early afternoon [20]. Producing a polar diagram of a Bronze Age (BA) type vessel The simulations of potential routes suggested in this paper rely on available performance data of a Bronze Age type vessel. The only vessel that can be argued represent a Bronze Age type vessel [3,17] and for which such performance data exists that could be used is the c.350 BC Hjortspring boat. This boat was found during peat excavations in the Hjortspring bog on the island of Als in southern Denmark in the 1880’s and was excavated in 1921–1922 [72]. About 40% of the boat has been recovered, enabling the reconstruction of a double ended plank-built boat that from stem to stem is c. 14 meters long, with a total of 10 internal thwarts, each with carved out seats for two paddlers (Fig 12) [72, 75]. The overall length of the boat is extended by two sets of horn projections at either end. The lower of these are attached to the c. 15.4 m long bottom plank which protrudes from the bottom plank at each end, whereas the upper horn projections extend outward and upwards following the shape of the gunwale, making the total length of the boat around 18 m [76]. With the find, 16 individually made paddles were found with relatively narrow blades, making them ideal for long distance paddling [77], along with two steering oars, one located at each end of the vessel [72]. Neither of the two steering oars were complete and estimates of their individual blade lengths vary between 53 cm [72] to 75 cm, but could have been longer still (Fig 13) [17]. Parallels to the unusual design features of the Hjortspring boat appear in depictions of boats in both rock art and bronzes dating from c. 1600 BC onwards in Scandinavia (Fig 12) and are also marked out on contemporary ship-settings in the region [3,20,42,78,79]. This, along with the refined boatbuilding technology employed in its construction, strongly suggests that it was built within a well-established Scandinavian boatbuilding tradition with its roots at the very beginning of the Bronze Age [3,20,53,80–82]. Hence it is justifiable to refer to it as a “Bronze Age Type Boat” despite it being of a slightly younger date [17,20]. A reconstruction of this boat, called the Tilia Alsie, was launched ready for sea trials in 1999 [76], and was, between 1999 and 2001, tested extensively by both members of the Hjortspringbådens Laug and professional Dragon boat racers under the supervision of Max Vinner from the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde [83]. Both the process of reconstruction and the on-water trials and their results have been published in the Ships and Boats of the North series in a volume co-edited by Ole Crumlin-Pedersen and Athena Trakadas in 2003 [75]. Further testing of the vessel was made in 2006, this time under sail, the results of which were published in the Maritime Journal of Archaeology in 2011 [17]. The performance data from the above publications has been collated and assessed for the purpose of making a series of polar diagrams, roughly equivalent to that of a BA type boat. This data on its own provides snippets of information of boat performance depending on the number of active paddlers and paddle strokes per minute, steering oar configuration and displacement. We are here using modern naval architect methods to fill in the gaps in this information to predict its performance across the full range of environmental conditions that can be expected when simulating long distance seafaring. This process has also depended on the availability of 3D-records of the Tilia Alsie’s hull shape and further helped by the many detailed geometrical and hydrodynamic calculations recorded such as the Tilia Alsie’s hull stability and resistance [75]. The Tilia Alsie varies from Johannessen’s interpretation of the original Hjortspring vessel in that it has a more curved profile, resulting in a much shorter water line (Fig 14). The overall difference in performance between the two versions has not been calculated or compensated for in the polar chart presented here but suggests the Tilia Alsie is a directionally less stable vessel than the original Hjortspring boat [20,83]. Velocity prediction processes applied to the BA type vessel To predict the boat speeds of the vessel in a range of environmental (i.e., wind direction/speeds and waves) and loading condition (number of crew and quantities of cargo/stores), a software tool was developed. This was based on existing methods usually applied to modern sailing yachts and powered vessels, but with adaptation to accommodate the feature differences of the Tilia Alsie in comparison to modern yachts. The paddling and sailing aspects were modelled with different models within the overall tool, though many of the components are common between the two approaches. This paper will focus on the paddling model. The paddling model consists of the balance of force components in the boat track axis and perpendicular to in the waterplane (i.e., side force), essentially, balancing the paddler thrust contribution to the opposed resistance components to obtain a boat speed for each combination of true wind speed and direction. For this the following forces are included: A 3D hull model was used to verify principal parameters for input into regressions and assess hydrostatics and stability. This provided inputs for various force component calculations so that a range of user defined loading and setup conditions could be tested, as can be seen in Fig 15. Assumptions and limitations of the paddling polar diagram used in simulations It is important to bear in mind that the polar diagrams presented here are prediction based on data sources in combination standard naval architectural procedures. Greater confidence in the results would be achieved using high-fidelity approaches such as Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) and model scale tank testing as inputs to the model(s) or by making further on water tests in either the Tilia Aslie or a reconstruction of its hull shape [17,90]. Nevertheless, the predicted polar diagram used here is based on several assumptions. Further to the above operational assumptions there are some immediate limitations that must be considered when using predicted paddled (or rowed) boat performance data for simulations. This primarily include the impact of leeway and waves on crew fatigue and the ability to keep an even pace over long distances under variable environmental conditions. There are unfortunately no adequate data for this since, e.g., the Tilia Alsie has mainly been used in very sheltered waters in maximum winds of c. 10 knots (pers. Comm. Valbjørn 2022). Leeway occurs when a boat is travelling at an angle to the wind which pushes it sideways (Fig 7). Here the air resistance created by a paddling crew seated as high up as it is in the Tilia Alsie (Fig 17), is considerable, and naturally contributes to leeway in a calculative way, as such this is reflected in the polar diagrams in Fig 16. The predicted boat performance in Fig 16 shows, for example, that leeway of 1 degree occurs already in winds below 5 knots when no steering oar is used. With double steering oars this threshold is more than doubled. Thus, even relatively small appendages such as the two steering oars found with the Hjortspring boat have a large effect on its boat performance, allowing more ease of operation through a considerably larger set of environmental conditions than no steering or only an aft steering oar. With supporting evidence of its use provided by boat iconography as well as the experience of its significant benefit during sea trials [83], we presume two steering oars would have been the norm for any long-distance seafaring venture. By studying the increase in leeway and decrease in speed in the polar chart (Fig 14) and combining this with hands-on experience from on-water trials it is possible to estimate reasonable limitations in a crew’s ability to maintain course stability and speed.

Again, the test was made in relatively sheltered waters so that even in wind conditions of 20 knots and of gusts of up to 28—32 knots (!), significant wave height encountered was only 1 meter. Provided the boat is made lighter in the bow (with crew and cargo being moved aft), it is estimated that the plough rail and the horn projections should help deflect bow waves of up to c. 2 meters height [74]. However, variability in the distance between gunwale and sea surface in-between each paddle stroke on account of waves rolling past, has a considerable effect on stroke efficiency and as a result crew endurance.

A survival limit indicates when a boat can no longer be operated and crew effort is entirely focused on making the vessel stay afloat (for more information on this, see Fig 17). As for wind strength, it is assumed that open sea crossings would only be initiated in conditions when the wind is below c. 5 knots (c. 3 m/s) and that at around c. 12 knots when leeway become more noticeable and require more paddling effort, the crew start choosing a course that is with or against the waves, rather than at an angle to the waves. This latter might have a large impact on navigational error (compare with navigational error in Fig 9). Thus, any simulation results will have to be checked against these limitations in wave height and wind strength. Methods for simulating sea trips using a voyaging modelling tool Trips between Thy and Lista are simulated with an ocean voyage agent-based model [91, 92] updated here to include the effects of navigational error. Vessel displacement is given by the sum of propulsion and current leeway velocities, with both of those dependent on winds and currents in the proximity of the vessel. Propulsion velocity is a function of the paddling speeds provided by the polar diagrams described above and vessel bearing. Current leeway velocity is the same as the local surface water velocity (Fig 18). The model code can be freely obtained at https://github.com/mtomasini/PLOS-Voyager. Wave information does not influence vessel displacement but is adopted in interpretation of results. Wave information does not influence vessel displacement but is adopted in interpretation of results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g018 Environmental conditions only affect displacement (the wind resistance of the active crew is allowed for withing the polar diagrams – any non-active crew members are assumed to be seated on the floor) While strong opposing winds and currents can drastically decrease the rate of progress toward the destination and even impede boats from reaching the end of the trip, vessels do not lose efficiency, become incapacitated or sink. The impact of adverse conditions is evaluated in the analysis of modelled trips. Note that given the potential impact of winds and currents on vessel movement, differences between the direction of vessel displacement and the vessel’s bearing toward the destination can exist (Fig 19). See text for detailed explanation and legend for abbreviations. In the example above, the vessel reached its destination in three time steps. The dashed circles around vessels indicate the environmental data used to calculate each displacement is obtained from the vicinity of the vessel. See text for detailed explanation and legend for abbreviations. In the example above, the vessel reached its destination in three time steps. The dashed circles around vessels indicate the environmental data used to calculate each displacement is obtained from the vicinity of the vessel. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g019 Simulated trips adopt two types of navigation strategies: open ocean and coastal. The following procedure is adopted in open ocean navigation (follow with Fig 19): At the start of the experiment or time 1 (T1), a vessel is positioned at a departure point (P1) and a bearing (B1) calculated based on P1 and the location of a destination point. Environmental information in the vicinity of P1 (dashed blue line) is obtained and displacement (D1) during a “time step” calculated by the model based on locally determined propulsion and current leeway velocities. Time step is the period at which vessel position is updated and kept at 15 minutes for all simulations (open ocean and coastal) discussed here. The displacement calculated at T1 (D1) is added to P1, generating a new position, P2, at time T2 (T2 = T1 + 15 minutes). The procedure is repeated until either the vessel arrives at its destination or the end of the experiment – 72 h– is reached. The open ocean navigation strategy is used to simulate direct trips between Thy and Lista across the Skagerrak strait and between the central western Swedish coast and the eastern Danish coast across the Kattegat strait. The coastal navigation scheme’s goal is to make vessels move from origin to destination within a “coastal corridor”, so that boats do not approach too close to nor move too far from the shore (follow with Fig 20. See also [91]; appendix 2.2). This is done by having vessels navigate toward a sequence of numbered “provisory targets”. Provisory target numbers increase from origin to destination. While origin and destination points are related to locations over land, these are positioned over water within the coastal corridor. At any time step, the model identifies the provisory target closest to the vessel and calculates a bearing toward the next target in the sequence. So that the first bearing (B1) is oriented toward provisory target 2 (X2). As with direct crossings, bearings are defined at each 15-minute time step and depend on vessel and provisory target position. Vessels keep moving along the coast until either destination or end of experiment - 30 days - is reached. Coastal trips adopt the same environmental data search radius as open ocean experiments (see Fig 19). For clarity, the data search radius and vessel image are not shown here. In the example above, the vessel reached its destination in six time steps. Coastal trips adopt the same environmental data search radius as open ocean experiments (see Fig 19). For clarity, the data search radius and vessel image are not shown here. In the example above, the vessel reached its destination in six time steps. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g020 The adoption of sequential targets provides a trustworthy first order representation of coastal displacement but may overestimate trip duration by forcing boats to follow the coast in situations where navigators might be able to sail across the mouth of an embayment instead of following along its coast. Despite this limitation, we believe sequential targets, given the lack of knowledge of Bronze Age navigation strategies and the large difference in duration between open ocean and coastal trips is a viable option given our present goals. Even with the adoption of sequential provisory targets, strong winds and currents can overcome propulsion speeds and push a vessel against the coast, causing a non-desired landing. To avoid this, when vessels come within 0.05 degrees distance of land (~6 km on the E-W and ~ 3 km on N-S directions) the model adopts a “corrected bearing” for the next time step. The corrected bearing is determined by deflecting the original model bearing by 90°. Using Fig 20b as an example: due to the vessel’s proximity to land after the displacement calculated for time step 3, bearing B4 is changed to corrected bearing CB4 so that CB4 = B4-90o. The negative sign here causes the vessel to stir away from the land; in case of land present on the left hand of the vessel, a positive deflection angle would be added. Given the lack of information on seafarers’ navigational skills, open ocean crossings are simulated under three distinct scenarios to overcome problems related to navigational error (see Fig 11). In the no error experiments, boats have perfect bearing and are oriented towards the target at all time steps (the equivalent of using modern sat nav data or GPS but might also reflect coastal routes with regular distinct landmarks). In the 10-degree (10°) error experiments, bearings have a random, normally distributed error with standard deviation of + /- 10° from the perfect bearing. This is a probable scenario for most short open (out of sight of land) sea passages in prefect weather and, potentially also for longer open water crossing depending on the skill and experience of the navigator. The bearing error is calculated and changes for each time step. The same procedure is followed for the 25-degree error simulations, with the error ranging from + /-25°, allowing for an exaggerated, worst scenario navigational error. Since seafarers performing coastal voyages can constantly sight land, and assuming this means they would be able to better determine a bearing parallel to the shore, coastal trips are only simulated with perfect and 10-degree error bearings. The period of daylight is an important factor in both simulations and analysis of results. We choose to adopt as length of daylight the time between the start of civil dawn and end of civil dusk; meaning the period of the day starting when the geometric center of the sun is 6° below the horizon before sunrise and 6° below the horizon after sunset. This is done because during civil twilight the horizon and land features can be discerned and hence navigation deemed feasible. Depending on atmospheric conditions, the horizon might remain visible up to the nautical twilight, when the geometric center of the sun is 12° below the horizon. We adopt civic twilight as a conservative (shorter daylight period) approach as the potential existence of some illumination at the end of daily simulated displacement is part of the rationale of how coastal trips experiments are designed. Coastal trip experiments assume boat occupants would avoid travelling at night. Trips start at sunrise from a departure point within the coastal corridor and displacement is calculated until sunset on day 1. At this time movement stops until the sunrise of day 2, and so on until either the destination is reached, or 30 days go by. That is, the last position at sunset of day N provides the initial position at sunrise of day N + 1. A back-and-forth trip between this position and land is implicit but not simulated. The assumption is that the movement to and from the coast would take place under illumination still available between civic and nautical twilights. This means that coastal trip simulations reproduce optimal utilization of daylight. Open ocean trips also start at sunrise but are allowed to continue after sunset for up to 72 h. Open ocean and coastal trips are simulated for both directions of travel (Thy to Lista and vice versa). Trips are initiated daily for the 28-year period - determined by the availability of environmental data - between January 2, 1993, and December 31, 2020; resulting in 10,226 voyages simulated for each experiment. Environmental data Land distribution, wind and current information comes from present day Era5 reanalysis data generated and distributed by the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) [93]. Reanalysis data can be understood as a blend of modelled and observed values organized on regularly spaced grids and at constant time intervals. These are commonly adopted by voyaging simulations as they provide the temporal and spatial resolutions and coverages required by models (Montenegro, 2024). Original wind data consists of three hourly values with 5.5 x 5.5 km spatial resolution. Original currents consist of daily values with spatial resolution of either 4x4 km or 0.111°x0.067° (or approximately 1.2 km in the north-south direction and 4 km in the east-west direction). Waves do not influence modelled vessel displacement, but hourly wave data with 2x2 km resolution coming from the same ECMWF product is used in analysis of results. Prior to inclusion in the model and analysis, all original environmental data sets are interpolated into a 2x2 km grid with 1 hour temporal resolution. Tidal flows, which can be significant in channels and near shore areas, are not present in the adopted current data. While tide should be considered when simulating particular trips being performed at specific dates and times, they play a much smaller role in affecting results in the type of analysis conducted here. Our vessels started/ended their displacements without any consideration for tidal phase. Assuming tidal currents were present in our input data, this would mean that among the 10k + voyages simulated per experiment, trips would be initiated/ended under a large range of tidal amplitudes. Some trips would be started/ended under tidal currents in their favour, some with currents against them, other under weak tidal currents with little impact on vessel movement. If we were to average these tide-influenced results into the multi-year daily and monthly means presented below, the most significant tidal effects would be “averaged out”. More than that. Tides in the region are mostly semi-diurnal. In both daily coastal trips and open ocean crossings, vessels are in the water for multi-hour periods that last about 1 to almost 2 dominant tidal cycles. This means that, given their durations, even individual trips tend to experience tidal currents that both favour and hinder displacement toward a specific direction. In short, given how model output is treated and mean individual trip duration, the adoption of input currents that contained tidal flows would not have had a large impact on our conclusions. The use of present-day environmental information as a proxy for earlier climate states is a common strategy when it comes to ocean voyaging simulations, particularly for those dealing with events taking place over the last 5 thousand years, when at least the global climate has not changed significantly [94–97]. The alternative would be either paleoproxy-based local reconstructions or output from paleoclimate model simulations. Although significant uncertainty exists in wind and current reconstructions, it could be argued that paleoproxies could provide more representative values at a particular location. However, these do not have anywhere near the spatial coverage and temporal resolution required by the voyaging simulations. While paleoclimate models solve the spatial coverage problem, most of these have spatial resolution of many tens to hundreds of kilometers and we are not aware of available paleoclimate model output with the spatial resolution required by our experiments. Another limitation is that, as with all global climate models, paleoclimate simulations tend to underestimate environmental temporal variability [98, 99]. Given the importance of seasonal variability in the region and the short duration (order of hours) of our simulated trips, we believe that present day reanalysis products offer, at this time, the best available input data for our experiments. Results Analyses of the results are focused on generating quantitative estimates of risk and effort involved in trips between Thy and Lista and on describing how these changes seasonally. Trip risk and effort are evaluated in terms of trip duration - particularly in relation to availability of daylight - waves, winds, and currents encountered by boat occupants during trips. Daily and monthly values represent averages covering the 28 simulated years. Thy-lista open ocean trips Simulated trips that arrive at their destinations tend to display relatively direct trajectories. As expected, trajectories are more direct (straighter) when smaller navigation error is adopted. During the April to August period more amenable to voyaging, no clear variation of trajectory shape as a function of trip direction or time of year is observed (Fig 21). Colours refer to trip month.

Cartopy uses public domain data from Natural Earth. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g021 Even when averaged over 28 years, there is marked day to day variability on environmental conditions faced by travelers (Fig 22) and trip duration (Fig 23). No matter the direction (Thy to Lista or vice versa), about 10% to 80% of trips encounter wave heights below or equal to (≤) 1 m, with lower percentages taking place in winter and higher values between April and August (Fig 22). Trips can be finished under daylight in both directions between March (April) and September (August) for a 10o (25o) navigational error. During the optimal late spring to summer months, a larger percentage of southern trips (~20% to 65%) finish under daylight compared to northward voyages (~10% to 50%). The period when both daylight and wave conditions are met continuously range from about April (May) to August (July) for the 10o (25o) navigational error. During this interval the percentage of trips under both thresholds vary from about 10% to 30%. A, northward trips (Thy to Lista) with 10o navigational error; C, same as A for 25o error. B, southward trips (Lista to Thy) with 10o navigational error; D, same as B for 25o error. A, northward trips (Thy to Lista) with 10o navigational error; C, same as A for 25o error.

Wave heigh limited trips have much longer duration and are plotted separately. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g023 When only the wave threshold is considered, average trip duration tends to be more than 20 h, with many trips, particularly southward ones, lasting 30 h or more (Fig 23). If daylight and wave limits are considered, spring and late summer trips tend to be shorter than summer ones, with larger navigational error leading to longer trip times. In general terms, between late spring and late summer, trips in both directions that last about 16 h to 19 h, are finished under daylight and encounter average waves heights below 1 m can take place at a rate of about once a week (Figs 23 and 24). Blue and orange refer to navigational errors of 10 and 25 respectively. Left (A) and right (B) panels refer to northward and southward trips respectively. Low risk is defined as trips finished under daylight and encountering average winds speeds and wave heights no greater than 5 m/s (10 kt) and 1 m respectively. Ideal trips also finish during daylight with wind speed and wave height thresholds of 3 m/s (6 kt) and 0.4 m. Values are monthly means.

Values are monthly means. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g024 Daylight and wave height limits identify risks associated with navigation, such as becoming lost at sea or stranded; and vessel stability, like capsizing or sinking. Wind intensity also constitutes a risk, not only via generation of sea waves, but also by potentially generating leeway velocities that would require large paddling efforts to be compensated, efforts that might not be sustainable for the many-hour trips between Thy and Lista. To evaluate the joined effects of winds, waves and day length, the polar diagram (see above) and expert opinion based on sea trials of the Tilia Alsie are used to identify what here we define as low-risk and ideal open ocean voyaging conditions. Low-risk trips are defined as trips finished under daylight and encountering average winds speeds and wave heights no greater than 10 kt and 1 m respectively. Ideal trips also finish during daylight with wind speed and wave height thresholds of 6 kt and 0.4 m. Low-risk trips in both directions take place from April and August; between May and July about 6% to 21% trips occur under low-risk conditions, with higher (lower) value related to the 10o (25o) navigational error results (Fig 24, Table 2). Trips taking place under ideal conditions are restricted to the period between May and August. They are much less common than low-risk ones, with the highest frequencies (~1.3% to 2.6%) seen in July for both directions (Fig 24, Table 2). Differences in navigational error do not have a large impact on the percentage of trips taking place under ideal conditions. This analysis points to June and July as the best months for travelling between Thy and Lista, with low-risk trips possible every five to seven days and ideal voyaging conditions occurring every 36 to 70 days, depending on the assumed navigational error (Fig 24, Table 2). Ideal and low risk trips tend to take place with winds and currents more or less aligned with the desired bearing, although portions of the trips can take place with environmental flows at large angles or even against the desired direction of travel (Fig 25). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.t002 Top and bottom figures come from northward (N) and southward (S) trips respectively.

Trips along the shore from Lista to the eastern margin of the Kattegat (Fig 26) last from about 11 to 20 days, with longer travel times from September to February and faster trips between April and August. The same seasonal pattern is simulated for movement in the opposite direction, but trips from the Kattegat to Lista are slightly faster, with durations ranging from about 9 to 17 days (Figs 26 and 27). As seen in the open ocean crossings described above, there is significant variability on trip duration depending on departure day. These durations should be interpreted as minimum voyaging times, or as number of required “days on the water”, as they refer to continuous traveling with no rest periods other than the nightly stops (see Methods). Considering wave risks, coastal trips in both directions are safer between April and August, when they do not encounter maximum wave heights above 2 m (Fig 27). The slightly higher maximum wave heights faced by southward trips is a function of their longer duration. Simulated vessels encounter lower waves along the coast compared to the open ocean, but given the adopted data set spatial resolution, even those lower coastal wave height values are very likely overestimates of what conditions would be like well protected areas between the shore and near shore islands. Simulated coastal trips from the Onsala Peninsula region to Lista takes on average 9 to 17 days (in a counterclockwise direction) with the quicker times from April to August, and with trips in the opposite direction on average two days longer. Top two boxes provide percentage of successful simulated trips and their minimum average duration in hours. Values for the trip along Limfjord (bottom box) are based on average propulsion and wind speeds and not on simulations. calculations alone. Based on best case scenario travel time between Thy and Lista varies between c. 19 hours (direct crossing of the Skagerrak) to c. 13 days minimum when following the longer coastal route.

The fact durations range from about 7 to 11 hours allow crossings under daylight even during the shortest winter days; and even between December and January, sheltered conditions mean that trips under daylight and encountering waves no higher than 1 m can occur about once every 5 to 6 days, or ~ 20% of the time (Fig 27). April to August provide the highest frequency of safe travel days, with daylight, low wave height trips possible for about 50% to 75% of the time. During this safer period for travel, trips last about 8 h to 11 h, and trips from Denmark to Sweden are slightly faster than those in the opposite direction (Fig 28). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g028 Discussion The ocean modelling tool presented in this paper uses modern environmental data and predicted performance data of a BA type vessel (the latter, compared to on-water performance data) to discuss communication and potential trade between Thy and Lista in the Early Bronze Age of Scandinavia. The close similarities within the archaeological record for these two regions and their relative geographic situation on either side of the Skagerrak has invited suggestions of direct open water sea crossings of 110 to 180 kilometres already at the onset of the Early Bronze Age (i.e., Late Neolithic), which, depending on the weather conditions and visibility, might have included up to 50 kilometres of navigation out of sight of land. The only other viable alternative for explaining the close similarities within the archaeological record in the two regions is that communication mainly took place along the 700 km long coastal route, which we suggest might have involved following the Limfjord to the east from Thy, crossing the Kattegat via the sheltered waters surrounding present-day Læsø and proceeding onwards within the shielded archipelagos [20]. Whilst the direct Skagerrak crossing might have taken 16-19 hours, to which time to the simulated points of departure/arrival from any nearby landing sites that might represent the actual points of departure/arrival (the simulations must start from a bit further out at sea due to availability of environmental data) should be added, the longer route would take between a minimum of 12 to 22 days (Fig 26). Also, for this longer route additional time most likely must be added but for different reasons (see below). Any uncertainties in the predicted performance of an Early BA type vessel based on the c. 350 BC Hjortspring boat, navigational abilities, and questions related to by what extent today’s environmental conditions agrees with prehistoric conditions, have been addressed during the process of setting parameters and limitations for these simulations. Importantly, any of these parameters and limitations can be further altered and adjusted in future simulations. Based on the assumption that navigation was primarily undertaken during hours of light (with the exception of longer open sea voyages during months when the sun never sets beyond 8 degrees below the horizon), these simulations suggest attempts to paddle across the Skagerrak in a BA type boat would have been limited to the months of April to August if allowing for a larger (exaggerated) navigational error and, when applying wave data, further limited to between May and July. Furthermore, it is clear that ideal environmental conditions (winds of ≤ 6 knots and waves ≤ 0.4 m), representing the conditions the Hjortspring boat is ideally suited for, only occur for 1.3-2.6% of all simulated trips during these months (one day every 30-70 days or the equivalent to c. 1-3 times per seafaring season) which does not satisfactorily explain the archaeological record and would further suggest an ability to pick out these particular days to be of use for early seafarers intent on this passage. Given the large variability in the regional weather, both navigational skills as well as weather predictions skills must therefore have been well developed before these crossings were attempted in the type of boat and propulsion chosen for these simulations. If, therefore, assuming better navigational abilities (within ± 10 degrees) and weather prediction skills to match, while also extending the allowance for the environmental conditions encountered during the direct open water trips to also include low-risk conditions (winds ≤ 10 knots and waves ≤ 1 m), the number of days during which trips might succeed increases dramatically to one in every 5-6 days or roughly one every week during the same period of time. This by itself indicates the dramatic difference in success rate of the open sea crossing simulated here if a vessel can handle larger waves. The potential skill involved in identifying suitable conditions for a successful crossing is revealed by zooming in on individual simulated trips, a method that can also be used to check the validity of any simulated trips (Fig 23). Here we find that even in ideal conditions, successful trips mainly occur when wind, wind induced waves and currents run in the same general direction as the intended direction of travel. The more wind and the larger the waves the more obvious this relationship becomes. It also means that potentially, provided the boat can be loaded in a way that reduces weight in the bow, and a method of securing the forward steering oar which does not require active steering in this end, one could assume that the BA type vessel used here might have been capable of using a following wind to paddle across also in a higher wind register provided waves stay within the one meter mark. This latter would of course be very dependent on paddlers capable of maintaining speed for the duration of the trip (compare Fig 17). Furthermore, the large variability in weather conditions within the region highlights the advantage of speed when attempting a direct sea crossing, as it minimizes the danger of any sudden weather changes. It is also clear that the two large currents in the region (the Jutland stream running along the southern shores of the Skagerrak) and the Baltic stream (running along eastern shores of the Kattegat, and the eastern and northern shores of the Skagerrak) have negligible impact on simulated trips in comparison to the speed and direction of the wind. The longer coast hugging sea journey simulated here is not as dependent on a particular season, mainly on account of the more sheltered waterways with associated lower wave amplitude. This is evident even though, given the spatial resolution of the available wave data, the wave amplitudes used for simulating the coastal trips do not include the full buffering effect of the archipelago (compare with Fig 11 and Table 1). This also means that a crew with a basic level of seamanship is very unlikely to come into difficulties within the shielded buffer zones. Thus, variations in navigational skills mainly affect the time it takes to reach a destination but has less impact on safety. The length of passage each day is however dependent on available light since the archipelago is difficult to navigate at night unless there is a clear sky and full moon (which we cannot simulate for). It is important to bear in mind that the simulated results are based on non-stop travel on the assumption that although stop over points during hours of darkness provides additional resting time for the crew, it excludes any time that might be needed to restock food and water. If assuming the boat needs to restock every two to three days, any sea route taken needs to be more carefully planned to include places where food and water can be obtained, which also adds extra days or half-days to the total journey. In a scenario where a crew paddles non-stop for 19 or 20 hours between two points where they are expected and welcome, extra supplies on-board might be kept at a minimum. The potential danger of dehydration for an active paddling crew, however, means water is more dangerous to cut back on. If assuming the physical exertion of paddling is equivalent to a light jog, a fit male (assuming the average crew is male) who is c. 1.70-1.74 m tall [100], weighs around 65 kg and is between 18 and 30 years of age, might need up to 6 litres of water for a trip of this magnitude to compensate for water loss due to sweating (which is higher the fitter the person is) and consumption of dry food. Fig 29 provides an estimate of the breakdown of the displacement and essential cargo of the paddled BA type vessel used for these simulations, which clearly demonstrates the relatively small amount of extra cargo that can be taken on-board and the level of planning involved in preparing and executing long distance sea journeys, weighing aspects of safety, equipment and the welfare of the crew against the capability of carrying extra cargo [20]. 3000 kg equivalent to a fully loaded Hjortspring boat [83], use here to represent a BA type vessel. We assume a full crew would have consisted of 16 active paddlers, an extra four taking turns, as well as two crew members on the two steering oars. 3000 kg equivalent to a fully loaded Hjortspring boat [83], use here to represent a BA type vessel. We assume a full crew would have consisted of 16 active paddlers, an extra four taking turns, as well as two crew members on the two steering oars. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g029 The disadvantage of a relatively small hold becomes even more noticeable when adjusted for the longer coastal route (Fig 26) where speed (number of active paddlers) must be set against the extra amount of cargo that can be taken on-board (roughly 100 kg per paddler). For sea journeys potentially lasting several weeks, a lack of food would become a problem if stocks were not maintained. Not only does the constant paddling require an intake of extra calories, but the body also burns more calories just by being on water (perhaps as much as 40%). Whereas easily digestible dry food that is not easily ruined by salt water might be brought along and consumed en route, a warm meal and a fire might have been desirable every three days or so, not least to keep up morale, and could be timed to coincide with the regular restocking of food and water. This suggests that for the longer journey additional re-stocking time is added, at a minimum, every three days depending on how many days’ worth of food/water is carried on-board. As can be seen in the calculations for total displacement based on long distance paddling for up to 10 hours a day (Fig 30), the amount of additional cargo that can be carried to the destination is very limited when propelled by paddling. 3000 kg of the BA type vessel used in our simulation, based on 20 paddlers (16 active plus 4 taking turns paddling/bailing) and two on the steering oars during a long-distance trip. 3000 kg of the BA type vessel used in our simulation, based on 20 paddlers (16 active plus 4 taking turns paddling/bailing) and two on the steering oars during a long-distance trip. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g030 The simulations presented here suggest the sheltered coastal waterways can be used all year around and that they therefore are very likely to have served as a form of prehistoric “highway”, vastly facilitating sea journeys that could be undertaken within the light hours of a day. It also demonstrates the relative ease of communication within the Limfjord (two to four paddling days from end to end) and the potential for regular communication from the Limfjord across to the eastern shores of the Kattegat, which is possible all year around over the course of a day, but most favourable during the months of April to August when successful crossings can be made every second day to every three out of four days (Fig 26). The route that best explains the level of similarities within the archaeological contexts in Thy and Lista is the direct sea crossing within the “low-risk” register, which would place significant importance on seafaring abilities, including navigational abilities out of sight of land and short-term weather forecasting, and would imply the use of boats capable of maintaining speed also in waves. While a boat such as the Hjortspring boat would most likely have been capable of making successful crossings under ideal and low-risk conditions in a following wind (using two steering oars) the question of how much cargo that can be carried across and under what circumstances the potential risks involved in such a crossing becomes worthwhile remains at large. It has been suggested an average cargo of raw bronze metals might lie in the region of 80 kg [3], which no doubt any single crossing would be able to accommodate and thus justify the risk. However, this by itself would not explain the close relationship between the Thy and Lista, nor the risks taken by each attempted crossing, Therefore, trades in other commodities as well as alliances must be at play which might include more bulky types of trade including, e.g., slaves, furs and even animals, which would also suggest larger vessel might have been used. The significance of both the direction of the wind and wind induced waves for the progress and speed of a BA type boat in combination with the variable weather conditions in these waters suggest planning of routes would always have featured in any kind of sea journey. Indirect evidence from within the region now suggest relatively large vessels, as well as sail might have been used already by 1600 BC [3]. The results of the simulations presented here would support this finding on two important points. The first is that even when paddling, crossing the Skagerrak would have been dependent on the direction of the wind [20]. Secondly, bulky cargo would necessitate a reduced crew on a Hjortspring type boat, or alternatively a wider vessel in comparison to its overall length, both of which suggest the additional use of sail in order to ensure success in a direct crossing [3]. This would also better fit with the close archaeological connection between the two regions. Interesting follow-on questions here include what might have led to the establishment of a direct route between Thy and Lista and when such voyages might have commenced? Here a knowledge of the significance of thermal cumulus clouds forming over land is likely to have been crucial (Fig. 5). Such clouds can reach heights of up to 2000 meters or more when fully developed towards the late afternoon, usually between 5 to 20 kilometres inland from the coast (Fig. 31). During the right atmospheric conditions, such clouds forming over the Norwegian coast are therefore likely to be visible when looking north from Hanstholm, even when calculating on a cloud height of only 1000 meters, and when standing on the beach if such clouds were fully developed. This would have provided the firm knowledge and the general direction of a distant landmass across the Skagerrak, meaning direct crossings might have been initiated from either direction (Thy or Lista). Therefore, direct journeys might have been commenced as and when seafarers were capable of navigating the full distance regardless of the presence of thermal clouds (or optimal atmospheric conditions), and when the needs for such journeys outweighed the perceived risks of undertaking them. The archaeological evidence suggests this happened already around 2300 BC. At this time archaeological evidence also suggest the northward coast from Lista towards the Stavanger fjord was also regularly used, a comparatively exposed stretch of coast that is likely to have necessitated vessels of similar capabilities as those used for direct crossings of the Skagerrak [3]. Calculations here are based on cloud formation reaching a height of 1000 meters. Cumulus clouds can build up to over 2000 meters height and would then have been visible by a person standing on the shore looking across without the need to stand at a height. Calculations here are based on cloud formation reaching a height of 1000 meters. Cumulus clouds can build up to over 2000 meters height and would then have been visible by a person standing on the shore looking across without the need to stand at a height. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320791.g031 Thus, the methods and tools presented here for evaluating prehistoric sea travels also allow for very fine-grained discussions on what the minimum boat requirements would have been for particular sea journeys. Conclusions The significance of maritime travel during the Nordic Bronze Age cannot be overstated, as evidenced by the extensive research published over the last two decades [34,35,101,102]. Although sturdy, these studies tend to present maritime travels as hypotheses based on a combination of theoretical frameworks and archaeological data. With this paper, we have set out to methodologically scrutinise and test these hypotheses with a new ocean voyage simulation tool and the application of boat performance data of a BA type boat. Our findings show that systematic and regular crossings over long stretches of open sea where possible in vessels similar to the Hjortspring boat and that such journeys might have begun already by c. 2300 BC. Nevertheless, successful journeys needed crews with extensive maritime know-how, and seafaring skills. Even though the longer and safer journey between Thy and Lista would seem like the most obvious choice, we argue here that the shorter and more hazardous journey across the Skagerrak strait were used extensively during the warmer month of the year. This is further strengthened by the similarities in the archaeological material, particularly the earthen mounds, which cannot be found along the Swedish and Eastern Norwegian coast. Allowing for the interaction between predicted boat performance data within multiple years of environmental data makes it possible to break down and analyse all the multitude of components that underpin sea travel. The model developed to predict boat performance of the Tilia Alsie, can be adapted to any type of prehistoric or modern vessel provided its hull shape is digitally recorded, and there are sufficient recorded parameters of the vessel. This calls for the systematic recording of all types of prehistoric boat reconstructions [74], which includes the impact of waves on boat speed and crew endurance. Such information would allow for the direct comparison of results from different types of boats (prehistoric/modern whether, e.g., paddled/sailed), encountering the same multi-year environmental data, while travelling between points within the same geographic time frame, or corresponding geographic time frames where coastal configuration has changed. This offers huge potential for future studies of seafaring in the past while also making it possible to reanalyse already existing studies of seafaring that have been based on other methods. Acknowledgments We greatly thank the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde for supplying the digital 3D hull data of the Tilia Alsie and Knut Valbjørn and Niels Peder Fenger, for helpful comments during the process of producing the polar diagrams and establishing reasonable limitations for these simulations.

"Reforestation in the burned areas of Parnitha on Sunday, March 30","The Chatzigakis Foundation is collaborating with the General Directorate of Forests and Forest Environment, as well as the Municipality of Acharnes, in honor of World Forest Day
The post Reforestation in the burned areas of Parnitha on Sunday, March 30 appear…","Reforestation in the burned areas of Parnitha on Sunday, March 30 A volunteer-led reforestation effort will take place in the burned areas of Parnitha on Sunday, March 30. In honor of World Forest Day, the Chatzigakis Foundation is joining forces with the General Directorate of Forests and Forest Environment and the Municipality of Acharnes to organize the 2025 Day of Giving and Inclusion. On Sunday, March 30, 2025, from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, more than 150 volunteers—including students, educators, social workers, and individuals with disabilities—will gather in Parnitha for a series of hands-on activities. The event will begin at the Agia Triada Forest Nursery and continue with an open reforestation initiative in a burned area of the region. The goal is to promote collective environmental action, solidarity, and inclusivity. A Day of Giving and Inclusion The overarching aim of the Day of Giving and Inclusion is to cultivate environmentally active communities. Specifically, the initiative seeks to provide experiential learning about the journey from a single seed to an entire forest. It highlights the importance of collaboration and emphasizes that forest care is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time effort. Long-term sustainability requires continuous maintenance efforts, beginning with forest nurseries and extending into broader conservation strategies. The Importance of Forests “Healthy forests are essential for people and the planet. They act as natural filters, providing clean air and water while serving as havens of biodiversity. They help regulate our climate by influencing rainfall patterns, cooling urban areas, and absorbing one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, forests provide livelihoods, medicine, food, and shelter for many communities and Indigenous peoples,” states António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations. The importance of protecting forests becomes even clearer when considering that approximately 10 million hectares of forest are destroyed each year. This devastation is largely driven by human activities, including unsustainable consumption and production patterns, deforestation, wildfires, and overexploitation of natural resources.

Forests play a crucial role in the survival of communities, particularly Indigenous populations, and are vital in combating the climate crisis by storing carbon. They serve as natural filters, purifying air and water, and are the source of numerous medicinal raw materials. Protecting and restoring forests is essential for a sustainable future.

Cannes Wish List: 33 Movies We Hope Make the Cut in 2025,It wouldn't be Cannes without a Wes Anderson. Or an Arnaud Desplechin. Or hopefully a Lynne Ramsay.

Cannes Wish List: 33 Movies We Hope Make the Cut in 2025 Ryan Lattanzio Cannes is back: The 78th French film festival returns May 13-24 with a wave of world premieres that will set the tone for the movie year ahead. Months earlier than the fall corridor that once positioned the narrative for awards season, Cannes is now the go-to first stop for new films that want to make an impact on the fall race. Just look at last year’s bounty: “Anora” won the Palme d’Or from a jury led by Greta Gerwig, played Telluride and Toronto, and went all the way to five Oscar wins for Best Picture, Best Director/Writer/Editor Sean Baker, and Best Actress Mikey Madison. Plus, 2024 competition winners including “The Substance” and “Emilia Pérez” also picked up Oscars, with “The Apprentice,” “The Girl with the Needle,” and “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” also netting Academy Awards nominations. The year before, Palme d’Or winner “Anatomy of a Fall” won the Best Screenplay Oscar, while Grand Prix winner “The Zone of Interest” won Best International Feature in addition to a Best Picture nomination. All that’s to say that it all starts in Cannes, where distributors will be lurking for the next big buy. Some companies, like A24, will already come to the festival armed and ready, as Spike Lee’s A24/Apple TV+ partnership is expected to drop on the Croisette. The pressure is on Neon, also, for a sixth consecutive Palme d’Or win after releasing “Anora,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” “Triangle of Sadness,” “Titane,” and “Parasite.” Wisely, Neon scooped up “Seed of the Sacred Fig” last year mid-festival with eyes on the prize once again, but the company already had it in the bag with “Anora” after all. Neon’s upcoming CinemaCon presentation should give us a clear idea of where they’re headed next. It wouldn’t be Cannes, either, without Wes Anderson bringing his latest film, “The Phoenician Scheme,” to France, with backing already from “Asteroid City” distributor Focus Features. Nor would it be Cannes, either, without new films from the likes of the Dardennes (“The Young Mother’s Home”), Arnaud Desplechin (“An Affair”), and hopefully Lynne Ramsay, who’s premiered all her films at the festival and has a new one coming with the Jennifer Lawrence-starrer “Die, My Love.” With the bottleneck in production created by the 2023 strikes out of the way, the 2025 edition of Cannes looks to be the biggest and boldest in some time (including, possibly, “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” from Kogonada). By a process of looking at inevitabilities, polling industry insiders, and making a few gutsy predictions of our own, IndieWire has rounded up 33 films we hope to see in Cannes — and many of which, errant surprises and discoveries aside, we likely will. The official Cannes lineup will be announced April 10. As previously announced, Juliette Binoche will lead the jury. David Ehrlich, Harrison Richlin, and Christian Zilko contributed to this story. “An Affair” (dir. Arnaud Desplechin) There’s seemingly no tallying how many films French director Arnaud Desplechin has premiered at Cannes — all of them, perhaps? — including new classics such as “A Christmas Tale” (2008) and “My Golden Days” (2015), with “Oh Mercy!” (2019) and “Brother and Sister” (2022) among the films that followed. “An Affair” features handsome “Call My Agent!” actor François Civil as a virtuoso pianist back from Asia and now reconnecting with a lost love in his hometown of Lyon. Nadia Tereszkiewicz, Charlotte Rampling, and Hippolyte Girardot round out the cast for Desplechin’s original script. —RL “Alpha” (dir. Julia Ducournau) Starring Golshifteh Farahani and Tahar Rahim, and set in a fictional city modeled after the New York of the 1980s, Julia Ducournau’s “Alpha” tells the story of an 11-year-old girl who begins to reckon with life and death when one of her parents falls ill against the backdrop of the AIDS epidemic. Somehow, we suspect that things aren’t quite as grounded and straightforward as that premise makes them sound — not when it comes to a new movie from the madwoman responsible for “Raw” and “Titane.” Production on “Alpha” didn’t wrap until late last fall, so it’s possible that Ducournau might have to wait until Venice to show the world what she’s been cooking up, but after winning the Palme with a wonderfully transgressive stunner about a serial killer who gets impregnated by a car, it would be a shame for her not to be on the Croisette for a victory lap. —DE “Amrum” (dir. Fatih Akin) Turkish-German filmmaker Fatih Akin reunites with Diane Kruger, who won Best Actress at Cannes for his wounding revenge drama “In the Fade” in 2017, for the historical drama “Amrum.” Akin co-wrote the film with “Goodbye Berlin” screenwriter Hark Bohm. It’s a World War II-era coming-of-age tale, led by newcomer Jasper Billerbeck, set on the titular German island in 1945 in the last days of the war. Billerbeck plays a 12-year-old boy, inspired by the 85-year-old Bohm’s own childhood, who hunts seals to help his family. Bohm co-write the script for “In the Fade,” and Akin’s 12th feature could either drop in the main slate or out of competition. “Amrum” is ready for hte festival, with Warner Bros. releasing it in German theaters in the fall. Akin’s “The Edge of Heaven” won best screenplay at Cannes in 2007, but he’s best known for the 2004 Golden Bear-winning dissipated romance “Head-On.” —RL “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” (dir. Kogonada) First gaining notoriety for his enlightening video essays, South Korean filmmaker Kogonada introduced himself as a sensitive, yet confident force in cinema with his 2017 debut “Colombus” starring John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson. He followed this with “After Yang,” a poetic sci-fi mystery that features Colin Farrell and Jodie Turner-Smith and further highlighted Kogonada’s gift for creating a unique cinematic language that speaks to the intricate themes of his narrative. Now, Kogonada is getting the chance to play on his largest canvas to date with “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey.” Described as a romantic fantasy, the film stars Farrell and Margot Robbie as strangers brought together for a one-of-a-kind trip. Initially slated for early May, the film was moved by Sony Pictures Releasing to September, suggesting a possible awards play and now making it eligible to premiere at Cannes. —HR “Calle Malaga” (dir. Maryam Touzani) Moroccan filmmaker and actress Maryam Touzani follows up her beloved Oscar entry “The Blue Caftan” from 2022 with “Calle Malaga,” the tale of a 74-year-old Spanish woman resisting her daughter’s decision to sell her Tangier home. Pedro Almodóvar muse Carmen Maura stars as the lead, who sets out to reclaim her furniture and home while becoming reawakened to love and sexuality. IndieWire understands the movie is ready for Cannes, and with Maura in the Cast and this being bold director Touzani’s first Spanish-language feature, there’s plenty of international appeal here for the premiere to make sense. Touzani was on the main competition jury in 2023. —RL “Chocobar” (dir. Lucrecia Martel) Leave it to Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel to make a provocative cinematic stance. She was, after all, head of the Venice jury that gave “Joker” the Golden Lion in 2019. She’s appeared at Cannes before, with “The Holy Girl” and “The Headless Woman” both competing for the Palme d’Or, and she’s primed for a Croisette appearance for her long-gestating hybrid project “Chocobar.” We’ve seen this one on these lists before: “Chocobar” is her first full-length nonfiction film, and it unpacks the murder of indigenous activist Javier Chocobar. Here, Martel threads together 500 years of colonial history to widen the scope on oppression in Latin American society. Chocobar was a member of the Chuschagasta indigenous community who was killed in 2009 over a land rights dispute. A trial wasn’t held until 2018, after which the convicted parties were freed due to court hold-ups on the ruling. Martel positions how Argentina’s colonial framework led to the events, incorporating historical archives dating back to the 16th century. —RL “The Chronology of Water” (dir. Kristen Stewart) Kristen Stewart has never been shy about her desire to create great cinema, and so — when the news broke (at Cannes in 2018!) that she would co-write and direct an adaptation of Lidia Luknavitch’s memoir “The Chronology of Water” — it hardly came as much of a surprise that she was stepping behind the camera. After years of waiting for the stars to align, Stewart finally rolled cameras last summer, with the great Imogen Poots playing Yuknavitch as she loses her swimming scholarship due to drugs and alcohol, meets “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” author Ken Kesey at the University of Oregon, and begins to experiment her way toward happiness. If, as widely expected, “The Chronology of Water” does earn a spot in one of the Cannes sidebars, it would be a full circle moment for an actress whose films have been a frequent highlight of the festival over the last decade. —DE “Couture” (dir. Alice Winocour) French filmmaker Alice Winocour is a Cannes regular with her features “Augustine” (2012), “Disorder” (2015), and “Revoir Paris” (2022) all premiering in various sections. She’s never cracked the main competition. Her new film “Couture,” starring Angelina Jolie and set amid Paris Fashion Week, was a hot title in the European Film Market at this year’s Berlinale, and it could pop at Cannes this year. Jolie plays an American film director who crosses paths with a South Sudanese model (Anyier Anei, herself a model and here making her film debut), and a French makeup artist (Ella Rumpf). —RL “Die, My Love” (dir. Lynne Ramsay) Scottish director Lynne Ramsay has premiered all her features at Cannes, dating back to her 1999 debut, the Un Certain Regard premiere “Ratcatcher.” Despite some stops and starts with other projects, Ramsay hasn’t completed a feature since 2017’s Cannes screenplay winner “You Were Never Really Here.” Her latest project “Die, My Love,” billed as a horror comedy, would bring the stars to Cannes, with Jennifer Lawrence playing a married woman spinning out in the countryside, and Robert Pattinson as her husband. LaKeith Stanfield, Sissy Spacek, and Nick Nolte are also in the cast. Ramsay adapts Ariana Harwicz’s novel, and as we know from films like “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” Ramsay takes the task of an adapted screenplay very loosely, reconfiguring source material to her own dark vision. Seamus McGarvey shot “Die, My Love” in 35mm with inspirations taken from Roman Polanski’s classics of female unraveling. —RL “The Disappearance of Josef Mengele” (dir. Kirill Serebrennikov) Another Cannes perennial is Kirill Serebrennikov, the Russian filmmaker whose epic tapestries of Russian life past and present have included “Petrov’s Flu,” “Tchaikovsky’s Wife,” “Leto,” and last year’s “Limonov: The Ballad,” which still doesn’t have a U.S. distributor despite a superb Ben Whishaw performance as the title dissident. Ready for Cannes is Serebrennikov’s next film, “The Disappearance of Josef Mengele,” starring August Diehl as the Nazi officer and doctor in the years of his life after World War II ended and he, like other SS members, fled to South America. It’s based on a historical fiction novel by Olivier Guez, published in French in 2017. Filming completed in Uruguay and Latvia by the end of 2024. —RL “The Doctor Says, I’ll Be Alright but I’m Feelin’ Blue” (dir. Mascha Schilinski) Little is known about Mascha Schilinski’s elaborately named “The Doctor Says I’ll Be Alright, but I’m Feeling Blue,” but word around the campfire is that the German filmmaker’s first feature since 2017’s “The Dark Blue Girl” is a major barnstormer that’s said to have taken Cannes’ selection committee by surprise. The multi-generational story of four girls (including Luise Heyer, pictured) growing up on the same farm at different times, Schilinski’s film may be riding a wave of hot whispers at the moment, but we’re still awaiting confirmation that it will be finished in time for the festival (and that it will be sticking with that wonderful title). Time will tell, but if it does indeed make the cut for the Competition line-up, be sure to keep an eye on it once the festival kicks off. —DE “Eddington” (dir. Ari Aster) Ari Aster hit the ground running as a filmmaker, combining indie pedigree with commercial horror to remarkable success with “Hereditary” and “Midsommar.” But his last film, “Beau Is Afraid,” signaled the beginning of a shift in his career. A visual representation of anxiety that was far more abstract than his previous fare, it made it clear that Aster’s work was now meant to be appreciated by festival audiences. His new film, “Eddington,” could very well mark his Cannes debut. Described as a politically-charged pandemic Western with horror elements, the film stars Joaquin Phoenix as a small town sheriff who squares off with the mayor played by Pedro Pascal. With a cast that also includes Emma Stone and Austin Butler, it’s already one of the most anticipated films of the year. —CZ “Father Mother Sister Brother” (dir. Jim Jarmusch) Jim Jarmusch has been in top form in recent years, making modern classics like “Only Lovers Left Alive” and “Patterson” in the 2010s. That ensures that expectations are high for his upcoming ensemble film “Father Mother Sister Brother,” an anthology film that boasts an all-star cast including Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Tom Waits, Vicky Krieps, and Mayim Bialik. Given that you can only count on a new Jarmusch film a couple times a decade, as the director famously pointed out in his “Bored to Death” cameo, a new one is always something to celebrate. —CZ “Highest 2 Lowest” (dir. Spike Lee) A reteaming between cinematic icons Denzel Washington and Spike Lee is more than enough reason for Cannes to roll out the red carpet, though, if we’re looking for symmetry, perhaps it would be more meaningful for “Highest 2 Lowest” to premiere at the Venice Film Festival in the fall. It was here in 1963 that Akira Kurosawa unveiled “High and Low,” the pulpy adaptation of “King’s Ransom” by Evan Hunter that serves as inspiration for Lee and Washington’s fifth collaboration and their first work together since 2006’s “Inside Man.” The cinematographer on that project, Matthew Libatique, also rejoins Lee’s posse, as well as his regular editor Barry Alexander Brown. Cast for the film includes rappers A$AP Rocky and Ice Spice, as well as Jeffrey Wright, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Michael Potts. Another collaboration to be recognized is between the film’s producers A24 and Apple Original Films, who formed a deal in 2018 to create work for theatrical distribution and streamer Apple TV+. Films such as “Boys State,” Sofia Coppola’s “On the Rocks,” Joel Coen’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” and the Jennifer Lawrence-led “Causeway” were previously made as part of this deal. —HR “The History of Sound” (dir. Oliver Hermanus) Josh O’Connor and Paul Mescal in a gay musical romance at Cannes would just about break the internet, and hopefully our hearts. South African director Oliver Hermanus (“Living”) has been long in the works on this adaptation of Ben Shattuck’s short story, with the “Challengers” and “All of Us Strangers” stars (O’Connor and Mescal have both gone gay before!) playing traveling folk singers in early 1900s New England. Hermanus’ past queer films including “Moffie” have won festival prizes; in other words, he knows how to frame a gay love story filled with longing. The film shot last year, with MUBI holding North American distribution rights. O’Connor also has a potential Cannes double bill on his hands with the possible premiere of Kelly Reichardt’s “The Mastermind.” —RL “I Want Your Sex” (dir. Gregg Araki) A decade has passed since Gregg Araki’s last film, the underrated “White Bird in a Blizzard” — though he made the Netflix series “Now Apocalypse” in the meantime — but the indie legend is preparing to make a splashy return to the limelight. His new film “I Want Your Sex” promises to be a return to the youthful, sexy films he cut his teeth on. Cooper Hoffman stars as a young man who is hired to be the sexual muse for an eccentric celebrity (Olivia Wilde). With a cast that also includes Charli XCX, Daveed Diggs, and Johnny Knoxville, the kinky film could help introduce Araki to a new generation of cinephiles. —CZ “The Last Day” (dir. Rachel Rose) Visual artist Rachel Rose makes her feature debut with “The Last Day,” a production of Killer Films inspired by Virginia Woolf’s “Mrs. Dalloway.” Cannes mainstay Alicia Vikander stars as Julia, a writer and mother confronting people from her past, including another troubled mother, while re-examining her creative life. Wagner Moura, Victoria Pedretti, Marin Ireland, and Jihae also feature in the ensemble for the film, which shot in New York City in fall 2024. Rose’s first-time filmmaking credentials mean this is a likely Un Certain Regard title, though stranger things have happened in the competition as Thierry Fremaux looks for more female-directed films to add in a historically male-driven lineup. Last year, the festival took a chance on Agathe Riedinger’s “Wild Diamond,” putting the drama in the competition with an early slot. Cannes loves Vikander, and a pensive drama with a miserabilist Euro-centric sensibility, so don’t count this one out. —RL “The Mastermind” (dir. Kelly Reichardt) Known for low-key, ruminative cinema like “Certain Women,” “First Cow,” and her last feature, “Showing Up,” Kelly Reichardt is one of indie cinema’s lasting treasures. Not much of her work has managed to gain a great deal of mainstream success, but that may be changing with the release of her upcoming project, “The Mastermind.” Starring Reichardt regular John Magaro, as well as rising stars Josh O’Connor and Alana Haim, the period film is said to follow a group of art thieves planning a score amidst the Vietnam War. Looking to repeat the success they had with Oscar-nominee “The Substance,” MUBI financed the film and will handle distribution in select territories, including North America. Reichardt has previously premiered two films at Cannes, “Wendy and Lucy” and “Showing Up,” the latter of which was nominated for the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or. Additional cast includes Hope Davis, Bill Camp, Gaby Hoffmann, and Amanda Plummer. —HR “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” (dir. Christopher McQuarrie) I will never forget the moment one afternoon at Cannes 2022 when I was grabbing a quick snack near the Palais when a screaming came across the sky as loud and sudden as the creation of the universe itself and I spilled espresso all over myself like an idiot — Tom Cruise (and “Top Gun: Maverick”) had arrived at the festival with the force of the movie gods. The film had already screened for critics by then, but it was an alarmingly physical reminder of the earth-shaking power that mega-stars can wield when they touch down on the Croisette. Ethan Hunt’s last(?) ride would be a major event no matter where it premiered, but debuting at Cannes would add an extra sense of occasion to both the film and the festival alike, even if I’m a little scared to see how Cruise might announce his presence this time. —DE “No Other Choice” (dir. Park Chan-wook) The first two episodes of “The Sympathizer” had their moments, but the gifts of a filmmaker as precise and symphonic as Park Chan-wook are wasted on television screens and production schedules, and so it’s glorious news that the “Decision to Leave” director has returned to his natural medium with the Donald Westlake adaptation “No Other Choice,” a characteristically bleak comedy about a long-unemployed man (“Squid Game” baddie Lee Byung-hun) who starts to murder the other contenders for the latest job he wants. The only bad news: Park didn’t wrap production until the end of January, which could make it difficult for such an exacting director to finish work on the project by the middle of May. The Competition line-up should be a corker either way, but it will be hard to ignore the gaping hole in the roster if Park has “No Other Choice” but to wait for the fall. —DE “Nouvelle Vague” (dir. Richard Linklater) Richard Linklater has always maintained firm ties to Austin, but has found great success making films set in Europe like the “Before” trilogy. His latest, “Nouvelle Vague,” takes him back to Paris for a look into the origins of the French New Wave. The film follows Jean-Luc Godard (Guillaume Marbeck) as he makes the transition from criticism to filmmaking with his debut feature “Breathless.” It’s hard to think of a more appropriate spot to premiere the film than Cannes, where French New Wave filmmakers made so much history, and the film has already been thrown out as a potential opening selection. —CZ “Orphan” (dir. László Nemes) Hungarian director László Nemes was the toast of Cannes and beyond in 2015 for his you-are-there Holocaust drama “Son of Saul,” which won the Grand Prix and the Academy Award for what was then called Best Foreign Language Film. Nemes’ drama “Orphan” filmed in Budapest last year and centers on a 12-year-old who comes to understand his own role in the 1956 Hungarian uprising against communism. Nemes’ last film “Sunset” premiered at Venice in 2018. The director again reunites with cinematographer Mátyás Erdély (“Son of Saul”), and Nemes made headlines last year for criticizing Jonathan Glazer’s viral “Zone of Interest” Oscar speech where Glazer condemned Israel’s actions in the war in Gaza. —RL “The Phoenician Scheme” (dir. Wes Anderson) Only two years since he unveiled “Asteroid City” on La Croisette and a year since his collections of short films “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More” dropped on Netflix, Wes Anderson is returning to the big screen this summer with a dark, 1940s-set tale of espionage featuring a typically-enormous ensemble cast of returning players and newcomers. “The Phoenician Scheme” follows the father-daughter dynamic between Benicio del Toro’s Zsa-zsa Korda (likely a reference to the Hungarian actress Zsa Zsa Gabor and Hungarian-born British filmmaker Alexander Korda), one of the wealthiest men in Europe, and Mia Threapleton’s Sister Liesl. Though Threapleton is Kate Winslet’s daughter, Winslet herself has never appeared in an Anderson film. The cast also includes Michael Cera, Riz Ahmed, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Wright, Hope Davis, Richard Ayoade, and Rupert Friend. —HR “Pillion” (dir. Harry Lighton) A24 has already acquired British director Harry Lighton’s feature debut “Pillion,” and we understand it to be very kinky and very gay. Alexander Skarsgård stars as the handsome leader of a bike gang who takes wallflower Harry Melling (“The Queen’s Gambit”) under his wing and potentially into his bed. As Colin (Melling) becomes Ray’s (Skarsgård) submissive, he’s thrown into a queer, sexually liberated underworld that shatters his sense of self. Lighton, a BAFTA nominee for the 2017 short “Wren Boys,” wrote the script from an Adam Mars-Jones novel called “Box Hill.” “Pillion” popped on the Cannes market last year, and Un Certain Regard feels like a reasonable landing place for first-feature director Lighton. “Resurrection” (dir. Bi Gan) Hong Kong and Taiwan film icon Shu Qi channels Tarkovsky for Chinese director Bi Gan in his latest film, “Resurrection,” his first feature since 2018’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” wowed Un Certain Regard with a 59-minute single take in 3D. Bi, who has crafted monumentally ambitious work for someone who’s only 35, reteams with “Long Day’s” cinematographer Dong Jingsong for a sci-fi mystery about a woman whose consciousness slips into an eternal time zone during a surgery. There, she meets an android corpse and attempts to awaken it by telling stories. Jackson Yee (“Better Days”) also stars in the film, which has been in the works since 2023. —RL “Rosebush Pruning” (dir. Karim Aïnouz) Karim Aïnouz is a Cannes regular, with his lurid sex-filled “Motel Destino” premiering in competition last year and 2019’s “The Invisible Life of Eurídice Gusmão” (Brazil’s Oscar submission for 2020) earning the Un Certain Regard prize. “Rosebush Pruning” is an English-language remake of Marco Bellocchio’s 1965 classic “Fists in the Pocket,” about an epileptic man who plots the killings of his own family. There’s been some musical casting chairs with this one, as Kristen Stewart and Josh O’Connor were originally set to star before those roles went to Riley Keough and Callum Turner. Jamie Bell, Lukas Gage, Tracy Letts, and Pamela Anderson are also in the ensemble, making for Aïnouz’s first English-speaking cast. The script comes from Yorgos Lanthimos’ friend and collaborator Efthimis Filippou, who wrote “Dogtooth,” “The Lobster,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” and “Kinds of Kindness.” Which means you should expect austerity and pained humor from the film, which shot in Spain last fall. and counts MUBI among its co-producers. No formal North American distribution has been set, though. —RL “The Secret Agent” (dir. Kleber Mendonça Filho) Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho has shared three films at Cannes, from the later-in-life portrait “Aquarius” with Sonia Braga to cult favorite “Bacurau” with Udo Kier and 2023’s arthouse theater documentary “Pictures of Ghosts,” nominated for the Golden Eye prize for nonfiction filmmaking. In his latest “The Secret Agent,” Filho directs Wagner Moura, the well-known Brazilian actor who broke out stateside in TV’s “Narcos” and the Alex Garland film “Civil War.” “The Secret Agent” also stars Kier and Gabriel Leone in a French/Brazilian co-production that follows a teacher entangled in the political turmoil of the final years of the Brazilian military dictatorship in the late 1970s. Filho shot the movie in his home country in 2024, and IndieWire hears this is ready and has been submitted to Cannes. —RL “Sentimental Value” (dir. Joachim Trier) Norway-based director Joachim Trier could return to the Cannes competition four years after his now-iconic “The Worst Person in the World” made Renate Reinsve an international star and won her Best Actress. The film went on to receive nominations for Best International Feature and Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars, so Cannes could do worse than slotting “Sentimental Value” in the main lineup. The secretive family drama centers on sisters mourning the loss of their mother, and welcoming back their estranged father, a screenwriter now offering a role to one of his daughters. “Worst Person” distributor Neon already has North American rights to the film, whose cast includes Elle Fanning and Stellan Skarsgård. “Sentimental Value” shot in Oslo last year, and since then Reinsve has continued her reign as a rising global star. Her drama “Armand” repped Norway at the Oscars this year, making the shortlist, and she was recently seen as Jake Gyllenhaal’s colleague and eventually murdered mistress in Apple TV+’s “Presumed Innocent.” —RL “Splitsville” (dir. Michael Angelo Covino) Michael Angelo Covino brought the beloved buddy comedy “The Climb” to Cannes Un Certain Regard in 2019, before Sony Pictures Classics turned it into a word-of-mouth cult hit during the pandemic. Star/actor/co-writer Covino is back, and with a buzzy ensemble, for “Splitsville.” Co-writer Kyle Marvin also stars alongside “Hit Man” and “Blink Twice” breakout Adria Arjona, Dakota Johnson, Nicholas Braun, David Castañeda, and O-T Fagbenle. This comedy of divorce and open marriage between Arjona and Marvin’s characters was produced by Topic Studios and Neon, which also handles distributing the film in North America. We hear it’s ready for Cannes. —RL “Two Prosecutors” (dir. Sergei Loznitsa) It also wouldn’t be Cannes without Sergei Loznitsa dropping his latest film on the Croisette, one IndieWire understands is ready for the festival. The Ukrainian filmmaker has previously brought seven movies to Cannes, competing for the Palme for his early narrative features “My Joy” and “In the Fog” as well as 2017’s “A Gentle Creature” before moving to Un Certain Regard with 2018’s “Donbass” and premiering documentaries like last year’s “The Invasion” at the festival. “Two Prosecutors,” which shot in Latvia last year, is Loznitsa’s first narrative feature since “Donbass.” The adaptation of Georgy Demidov’s novel centers on a prosecutor who challenges the system during Stalin’s Great Terror in 1937. —RL “The Way of the Wind” (dir. Terrence Malick) It sometimes feels like there are more credible arguments for the existence of Santa Claus than a finished cut of Terence Malick’s “The Way of the Wind.” The auteur’s Biblical epic, which offers a reworked telling of scenes from the life of Jesus Christ, wrapped production in 2019. Malick has been in post-production ever since, and has appeared to be in no rush to work through the 3,000 hours of footage he reportedly shot. The film has been rumored to premiere at every Cannes and Venice edition for the past half decade, but buzz once again suggests that this could be the year Malick’s opus finally sees the light of day. Nobody would blame you if you’ve been burned too many times to get your hopes up this year. But when (if?) the day comes when “The Way of the Wind” finally premieres, it will be a monumental event in film history. Maybe this is the year we get lucky. —CZ “The Young Mother’s Home” (dirs. Luc Dardenne, Jean-Pierre Dardenne) Ready for Cannes, we hear, is the Dardennes’ “The Young Mother’s Home,” and it wouldn’t be Cannes without the brothers premiering their latest social-realist drama at the festival. The Belgian duo received unusual news attention earlier this year when French actress Émilie Dequenne, who starred in their Palme d’Or-winning breakout “Rosetta” in 1999, died at age 43. This year’s festival could be a unique opportunity to celebrate that film as well as the directors’ latest work, about five young mothers eking out a living in a housing shelter. While the brothers’ “Tori and Lokita” went under the radar in 2022, their films almost always win prizes, from Best Director for “Young Ahmed” (2019) to the Grand Jury Prize for “The Kid with a Bike” “(2011) and another Palme d’Or for “L’enfant” (2005). —RL “Yes!” (dir. Nadav Lapid) Fueled by combustible self-conflict, the work of Tel Aviv-born filmmaker Nadav Lapid has always been freighted with his ambivalence — and, increasingly, his anger — toward his nationality. “Synonyms” revisited the period in his 20s when a young Lapid fled to Paris and violently attempted to shake off the Hebrew language after convincing himself that he’d been born in the Middle East by mistake, while 2021 Palme d’Or contender “Ahed’s Knee” directly confronted the impotence Lapid felt as an artist railing against nationalist violence from inside the belly of the beast. In that light, one would imagine that anything Lapid made over the last two years would be incandescently furious, but to judge from what little we know about “Yes!,” it sounds like he’s returned with… a remake of “Yes Man”? Somehow, we imagine that the Nadav Lapid movie about a guy who says “yes” to everything will be a little different than the Jim Carrey movie based on the same premise. Or maybe that title is an allusion to the last line of “Ulysses.” All signs suggest that we’ll learn the answers to these questions and more in May. —DE By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Figures Abstract Although globally scarce, Middle Jurassic dinosaur tracks are known from the Isle of Skye, Scotland, and help indicate the palaeoenvironmental preferences and behaviour of major dinosaur clades. Here, we report an extensive new tracksite from Skye: 131 in-situ dinosaur tracks at Prince Charles’s Point on the Trotternish Peninsula. The tracks occur in multiple horizons of rippled sandstones of the Late Bathonian aged Kilmaluag Formation, part of the Great Estuarine Group, which formed in a locally, shallowly submerged lagoon margin. We assign these tracks to two morphotypes, further divided into four morphotype subgroups, most likely representing large megalosaurid theropods, and sauropods that are either non-neosauropods or basal neosauropods. The trackways, although relatively short, evidence time-averaged milling behaviour, as observed at other tracksites in the Great Estuarine Group. The presence of sequential manus and pes sauropod tracks amends their previous identification by geologists as fish resting burrows, raising the potential that other such structures locally and globally may in fact be dinosaur tracks, and emphasises the predominant occurrence of sauropods in lagoonal palaeoenvironments in the Great Estuarine Group. At Prince Charles’s Point, however, unlike previously described lagoonal assemblages, large theropod trackmakers are more abundant than sauropods.

Introduction The Middle Jurassic (c. 174–164 Ma) was a time when many dinosaur clades including large-bodied and long-necked Eusauropoda/Neosauropoda, herbivorous Ornithischia, and carnivorous Theropoda (specifically allosauroids and coelurosaurs) diversified [1–4]. Despite this apparent diversification, the Middle Jurassic fossil record is sparse [5], and much of our understanding of dinosaur evolution from this time is implied from dated phylogenies rather than directly supported by considerable fossil evidence. On the Isle of Skye, the Great Estuarine Group (c. 170–166 Ma) is one of the most fossiliferous Middle Jurassic (Late Bajocian?-Bathonian) sedimentary sequences in the UK with a variety of subtropical terrestrial faunas [6–8]. Vertebrates from this sequence include crocodylomorphs, salamanders, stem lizards, turtles, docodont and tritylodontid cynodonts, and pterosaurs [7–20]. Although scarce, dinosaur body fossils are also present on Skye and a few other Inner Hebridean isles in Western Scotland. At present, specimens from Skye include: several sauropod teeth and vertebrae, a sauropod humerus, and a thyreophoran ulna and radius [21–25]. Theropods are represented by several teeth and a middle caudal vertebra [26–28]. Additionally, a thyreophoran limb bone, referred to a stegosaur fibula, was documented from the nearby Isle of Eigg [29]. Given the paucity of bone material, Scottish dinosaur communities have been primarily inferred from Skye’s abundant track record. The first scientifically described track (GLAHM V1980) by [30] was found in the Lealt Shale Formation at Rubha nam Bràthairean (Brothers’ Point) and is a large tridactyl track variably discussed as either a theropod [30] or an ornithopod [31–32]. Subsequent trackway discoveries throughout the Great Estuarine Group, including in the Lealt Shale, Duntulm, Valtos, and Kilmaluag formations, have illuminated a variety of dinosaurs present on Skye in the Middle Jurassic. These include theropods, sauropods, thyreophorans (particularly stegosaurs), and putative ornithopods [32–38]. Dinosaur tracks in the Kilmaluag Formation (c. 167 ma), in particular, include a small assemblage of theropod tracks from Lùb Score [35]. In general, however, tracks from the Kilmaluag Formation, largely formed in and near freshwater lagoons, are rarer than those preserved in the Great Estuarine Group facies formed on beaches, in or near brackish lagoons, or in fluviodeltaic settings. In this study, we document 131 newly discovered in-situ dinosaur tracks in the Kilmaluag Formation at Prince Charles’s Point, situated on the northwest coast of Skye’s Trotternish Peninsula (Fig 1). This site includes extensive and morphologically well-defined trackways of large theropods and sauropods, some of which are among the longest continuous track sequences yet found on Skye. Interestingly, some of the sauropod tracks encompassed features that had previously been identified as ‘fish resting/burrow traces’ [39]. Here, we present an alternative argument to show that they match the morphology of sauropod tracks, which opens the possibility that other such structures in local and global stratigraphy may in fact be dinosaur tracks. The presence of sauropods amongst theropods provides further evidence for their preferential use of lagoonal palaeoenvironments on Skye. Such tracks furthermore complement other in-situ tracksites and body fossils found on Skye. The tracksite is situated on the northwest coast of the Trotternish peninsula.

Log is adapted from [40,48 ] to show new observations – including beds with dinosaur tracks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g001 Geological and stratigraphic context The Great Estuarine Group contains a series of sedimentary formations deposited c. 170–166 Ma. The sediments represent alternating freshwater and marine-influenced delta and lagoonal systems in a paralic sequence [6,40,41]. Its constituent sedimentary formations crop out across the Inner Hebrides and were deposited across two basins – the Inner Hebrides Basin and the Sea of the Hebrides Basin. The Inner Hebrides Basin extended from the present-day Straithaird Peninsula, Skye, to the Isles of Eigg and Muck. The more northerly Sea of the Hebrides Basin extended from the Outer Hebrides landmass to the Central Skye Palaeo High – a hypothetical landmass now occupied by the Cullin Mountains [6,41]. Prince Charles’s Point would have been situated ~ 42.8°N within the Sea of the Hebrides basin [42]. The basin formed part of a series of low-lying small landmasses and shallow seas which resulted from localised volcanic induced uplift and falling global eustatic sea levels [41,43]. At Prince Charles’s Point, [40] logged a nine-bed sequence < 2 m in thickness (Fig 1C). The sequence is correlated to the clastic facies of the upper Kilmaluag Formation (late Bathonian, ~ 167 Ma). This correlation is supported by the presence of the freshwater ostracod Darwinula in most beds [40,41,44]. The sequence represents an ephemeral, low salinity, closed lagoonal system within a vast river delta alternating between subaerial and submerged states [40,45]. Beds 1-2 and 5 represent a regressive, lagoon margin (near-shoreline) palaeoenvironment, characterised by horizons of fine-grained rippled sandstones deposited by small rivers which fed the lagoon [40]. A lack of radial and desiccation cracks in and around dinosaur tracks present in bed 2 and 5 suggests the surface was shallowly submerged [46]. Intermittent periods of evaporation and extensive drying are indicated by brecciated and desiccated calcilutite dolomite and desiccated argillaceous shales (beds 4 and 8) [47]. Beds 6-7, and 9 are composed of argillaceous shales and silty shales and signify prolonged periods of increased river sediment input and lagoon margin transgression [40]. At Prince Charles’s Point, the majority of dinosaur tracks occur within bed 2 – measured by [40] as a ~ 10 cm thick bed of fine-grained sandstone with abundant ostracods (Fig 2); we note here that the thickness of this bed varies laterally and can be greater than 10 cm. We determined a south westerly bed dip of ~ 4° in bed 2. Additional tracks occur in bed 5 – a ~ 5 cm thick bed with near identical sediment properties to bed 2 (Fig 2). Bed 5 differs with the presence of intraclasts and lack of ostracods [48]. Both beds are pale-dark grey in colour on fresh surfaces and weather orange or dark grey. Bed 2 (A, B) preserves abundant ostracods while Bed 5 (C, D) lacked ostracods. Sections were examined under plane polarised light (A, C) and cross polarised light (B, D). Bed 2 (A, B) preserves abundant ostracods while Bed 5 (C, D) lacked ostracods. Sections were examined under plane polarised light (A, C) and cross polarised light (B, D). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g002 Bed 2 is composed of multiple generations of shallow, wave-generated, bifurcated, asymmetric current ripples [40]. Bed 5, in contrast, is composed of at least a single generation of these ripples. Each set of ripples typically varies between 2-4 cm in vertical thickness. Track-bearing horizons in beds 2 and 5 typically feature ripple wavelengths between ~ 5-8 cm. Non-track-bearing horizons in the same beds are characterised by ripple wavelengths between ~ 9-17 cm. Such wavelengths imply a greater water depth which might indicate inaccessibility to dinosaurs [49]. In a closed lagoon palaeoenvironment, wave-formed ripples may have formed perpendicular to wind-induced currents over very shallow water [49]. Sequence biota Other than dinosaur tracks, the outcrop at Prince Charles’s Point records a relatively minimal floral and faunal assemblage. Fish fragments are present in all beds, including a poorly preserved jawbone from bed 4 and scales within beds 2 and 8. Ostracods were previously recorded in infilled desiccation cracks within beds 6-9, and some exhibited rare ‘cup-in-cup’ preservation [48]. We additionally recorded ostracods in beds 1-2 (e.g., Fig 2A-B). A palynological study by [50] highlighted the presence of terrestrial miospores, predominantly gymnospermous pollen. Pollen such as Lycopodiacidites baculatus within the Prince Charles’s Point sequence constrained the locality to no younger than the Bathonian [51]. The presence of the planktonic alga Botryococcus and lack of marine palynomorphs provided further evidence that the depositional palaeoenvironment was non-marine [50]. The predominant absence of invertebrate bioturbation in all exposed beds may have reflected the rate of sediment accretion, food availability, or variation in salinity as recorded in deltaic palaeoenvironments [52–53]. Tracksite discovery In the early 1980s, Prince Charles’s Point was visited by Julian Andrews, who measured the section and documented ‘circular obstacle marks’ in bed 2 [40]. Later, Andrews discussed the possibility that the structures were ‘animal tracks’ but proceeded to identify them as fish resting burrows [39] – see ‘interpretation of sauropod tracks’ discussion section. In August 2019, Tone Blakesley (TB), Dugald Ross (DR), Anne Martin (AM), and Victoria Bradder (VB) visited Prince Charles’s Point and found three tridactyl tracks on the northerly, bed 2-dominated wave-cut platforms. The vast majority of tracks and trackways were discovered during subsequent fieldwork led by TB in July-August of 2021 and 2022 and in April 2023 and 2024. TB described this tracksite for his MScR dissertation at the University of Edinburgh [54]. Materials and methods Sampling permissions and ethics statement Permission to conduct fieldwork, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based photography, and collect sample sediments was provided by Ewan MacPherson (Kilmuir Estate landowner). No organic material was collected for this study. Field recording Prince Charles’s Point is a tidal platform and can only be accessed at low tide (ideally with a high tidal coefficient). Prior to the morphological description, photography, and measurement of in-situ tracks, seaweed and limpets were carefully removed from in and around tracks while seawater was sponged out of concave epirelief tracks. Trackways are regarded as sequences with ≥ 3 tracks, while track associations featured two consecutive tracks, sensu [55]. Each track is catalogued with a site-specific number with prefixes to denote: the locality (‘PC’ for Prince Charles’s Point); clade designation (‘TH’ for theropods, ‘SA’ for sauropods, ‘U’ for unidentified); ‘A’ for associated tracks or ‘I’ for isolated individual tracks; trackway/track association number; and track number. ‘PC-TH-1-07’ for example is theropod trackway one and track seven at the locality. During fieldwork, we described each track and recorded their location, bed, symmetry, relief, and preservation grade (see S1 Appendix of S7 Table). Orientations for isolated tracks were recorded in the field with a compass. Morphological preservation grading Previous studies by [56–57] graded the ‘morphological preservation’ of tracks on an ordinal scale of 0-3 (at 0.5 intervals) to state how well preserved a track is. Tracks graded closer to 3 are considered more diagnostic and suitable for characterising morphotypes. Grades are informed by the presence or absence, and sharpness and wear, of morphology. For our theropod tracks, grades are influenced by the preservation of digits ii-iv (digit i if present) and, for each digit, ungual marks, tapering, and phalangeal and metatarsophalangeal pads. Our sauropod tracks grades are influenced by the preservation of an overall track shape, digits i-iv, ungual marks, heel and pedal pads, and pad creases. The grading criteria are outlined in Table 1 in [57]. Complete theropod tracks graded ≥ 1.5 are measured and used to characterise morphotypes. Theropod tracks graded 1 are referred to specific morphotypes. Theropod tracks graded < 1 are either incomplete or possess poorly defined margins and are not measured or used to characterise morphotypes. Sauropod tracks graded ≥ 0.5 are used to characterise morphotypes. Photogrammetric datasets of tracks Photogrammetric image sets for individual tracks consist of ≥ 50 photographs taken at three relative angles in a circular rotation on a 24.2-megapixel resolution Nikon D5600 with a 35mm lens. Specific trackways were photographed with the camera attached to an ~ 2 m high monopod with a shutter release controller. Photographs were taken at near nadir angles and sequentially overlap. Each track or trackway was photographed in calm weather in bright, diffuse lighting conditions. Camera parameters included: aperture ≥ f13, ISO ≤ 640, and shutter speed ≥ 1/200. These parameters ensured that the photographs were sharp and not too grainy. We used a DJI Matrice 300 RTK UAV with a payload of a 45-megapixel Zenmuse P1 camera to survey the entire tracksite. All UAV flights were conducted in calm weather conditions with wind speeds < 15 mph. Due to weather constraints and UAV availability, flights took place in sunny conditions with the exposure compensation (EV) value lowered (up to -1.0) on photographs to compensate for bright lighting. The UAV was piloted via the DJI Pilot 2 app installed on a smart controller and flown autonomously using the smart oblique mode setting. This enabled the collection of a total of 4,528 images at five angles (928 images were nadir) at a 1.5-3 mm per pixel resolution from 12 m above the surface. Prior to flights, corner markers were placed to establish the limits of a defined ‘polygon’ area of interest. Ground control points (GCPs) were then placed randomly across the tracksite. Coordinates (WGS84) of the GCPs were recorded using Emlid Reach RS survey units. The base station was set up outside the area of interest at set coordinates. The receiver units were operated through the Emlid Flow iPhone app. The coordinates were post-processed through Emlid Studio using RINEX data from the Ordnance Survey Benbecula Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) for an absolute positioning reference. The reference station is 60.1 km from the tracksite. Generation of photogrammetric models Track and trackway 3D models were generated in Agisoft Metashape (Version 1.8.0, 64 bit, 2023) installed on two workstations (Athena and Goliath) based in the University of Edinburgh Airborne Research and Innovation facility. Workstation specs are: Athena (i7-7820X 8-core (16 with hyper-threading) and 1 x NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB, 128GB RAM) and Goliath (2 x Intel Xeon E5-2640V4/ 2.4 GHz processor Total: 20 cores, 40 threads, and 2 x ASUS GTX1080TI-FE, 256GB RAM). Models were generated following the workflow from [32]. The resolution parameters for point cloud and mesh generation were set to the ‘highest’ setting. For sharp texture generation, the source data was set to ‘3D model’ and other fields left on default. Due to the large area of the tracksite, high resolution models were generated from UAV imagery of two sections. Each section contained a concentration of several trackways. A model of the entire tracksite meanwhile was generated at lower resolution parameters (highest image alignment, high dense point cloud, medium mesh), to ensure the tracksite model was manipulable in post-processing software. This combination of resolutions ensured ripple marks were also resolvable. For handheld imagery of individual tracks or trackways, check points were placed to denote a scale reference on the track-bearing surface after the medium imagery alignment process. The scale calibration was then used to optimise the imagery in place of the GCPs. These were generated following the same ‘highest’ resolution workflow. Post-processing photogrammetric models Photogrammetric models were post-processed in Meshlab (Version 2022.02, 64 bit). Models > 2 GB were processed on a University of Edinburgh Geosciences CT lab workstation PC (Intel Xeon W-2125 CPU at 4.00GHz with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, 160GB RAM). A laptop workstation processed models < 2 GB (i7-11800H at 2.3 GHz with NVIDIA RTX™️ A3000 (6 GB GDDR6 dedicated) 32GB RAM). Meshlab was used to remove excessive mesh and boulders on trackway models to accurately set planes through the track-bearing surface. Subsequently generated digital representations included textured orthophotos, digital elevation maps (DEM), and contour maps in Paraview (Version 5.10.1) also installed on the laptop workstation. Contours on contour maps are spaced by 2 mm. Model outlines were drawn in Inkscape (Version 1.2.2, 64 bit). Track measurements For theropod tracks, we measured: the overall length (L), width (W), digit lengths (LII-LIV), and toe extension of digit iii (te), as used in [55,58,59], in FIJI ImageJ [60] (Fig 3A). Full pes track length measurements enabled tracks to be classified in accordance with [58] (Table 1). For sauropod manus and pes tracks, the overall length and width were respectively measured across the long and short axes sensu [63] (Fig 4). Each track was classified by track length size sensu [58] (Table 1). Due to their poor definition across all tracks, digits and pads were described qualitatively, but not individually measured. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t001 (A) Measurements for theropod tracks included: overall length (L), width (W), digit lengths (LII-LIV), toe extension length (te), and interdigital angles between digits ii-iii (α) and digits iii-iv (β). (B) Theropod track phalangeal pad configuration (2:3:4 formula) between digits ii-iv (right to left). (C) Bipedal trackway measurements derive from [55] and included: pace – the distance between common reference points (intersecting point (IP) of track length and width lines) on a sequential right and left track (RP and LP respectively); stride (λ) – the distance between two successive right or left track IPs; width of the pes angulation pattern (WAP) – overall width of stride from the IP of a respective alternate track; angle of rotation (α) – measured between the pace line and trackway midline (TML); and pace angulation (γ) – the angle of two intersecting pace lines from a preceding and proceeding track in the stride. The TML was drawn from the midpoints of pace lengths. (A) Measurements for theropod tracks included: overall length (L), width (W), digit lengths (LII-LIV), toe extension length (te), and interdigital angles between digits ii-iii (α) and digits iii-iv (β). (B) Theropod track phalangeal pad configuration (2:3:4 formula) between digits ii-iv (right to left). (C) Bipedal trackway measurements derive from [55] and included: pace – the distance between common reference points (intersecting point (IP) of track length and width lines) on a sequential right and left track (RP and LP respectively); stride (λ) – the distance between two successive right or left track IPs; width of the pes angulation pattern (WAP) – overall width of stride from the IP of a respective alternate track; angle of rotation (α) – measured between the pace line and trackway midline (TML); and pace angulation (γ) – the angle of two intersecting pace lines from a preceding and proceeding track in the stride. The TML was drawn from the midpoints of pace lengths. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g003 Measurements are based on [55,58]. (A-B) Pes and manus trackway measurements included overall pes (P) or manus (M) length (PL or ML) and width (PW or MW). As per bipedal tracks, right and left pes or manus paces (RPP or RMP and LPP or LMP) were measured between alternating track IPs, while strides (Pλ or Mλ) from the IP of two consecutive right or left tracks. Further measurements included the width of the pes angulation pattern (WAP), width of the manus angulation pattern (WAM), and the pes and manus angles of rotation (α) and pace angulation (γ). A track midline (PMD for pes and MMD for manus trackways) was drawn from the midpoint of pace lengths. Progression (PG) was based on the Pythagorean theorem and determined the distance between an IP of one track and WAP intersection point of a consecutive track within a respective stride. (C) The pes trackway ratio (gauge) was based on measurements perpendicular to the TMD including: side width ‘SW’ – measured across an individual track; and overall width ‘OW’ – measured across the outermost side width lines of consecutive pes tracks – as stipulated by [64]. Measurements are based on [55,58]. (A-B) Pes and manus trackway measurements included overall pes (P) or manus (M) length (PL or ML) and width (PW or MW). As per bipedal tracks, right and left pes or manus paces (RPP or RMP and LPP or LMP) were measured between alternating track IPs, while strides (Pλ or Mλ) from the IP of two consecutive right or left tracks.

(C) The pes trackway ratio (gauge) was based on measurements perpendicular to the TMD including: side width ‘SW’ – measured across an individual track; and overall width ‘OW’ – measured across the outermost side width lines of consecutive pes tracks – as stipulated by [64]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g004 Trackway measurements We measured trackway characteristics of both theropod (Fig 3C) and sauropod (Fig 4) trackways based on [55,58] using FIJI ImageJ [60] and Inkscape. Stride (λ) was measured between the intersecting point (IP) of the overall track length and width lines of two consecutive tracks impressed by the same foot. The right or left pace (RP or LP respectively) were measured between the IP of two consecutive, alternating tracks. The width of pes angulation (WAP) intersects the stride length line perpendicular from an IP and measures the trackway width. The track midline (TMD) was drawn between the midpoint of the pace length lines and interpolated for the first and final tracks in a visible sequence. The pace angulation (γ) was measured based on the intersection of two pace lines at an IP. The angle of rotation (α) was measured from the intersection of the pace length and TMD lines between two alternating tracks in the forward direction of the trackway. Track orientations for sauropod pes and manus tracks were measured between respective forward stride lines and track long axes (Fig 4A-B). The approximate track area of sauropod pes tracks (IPS) was calculated using Eq 1, while Eq 2 determined the manus track area (IMS) [65]. Heteropody (Eq 3) expressed the difference between the areas of a paired pes and manus track as a ratio [66]. While [67] illustrates carpal width might provide a better overall estimate, an absence of clearly defined digits on most of the sauropod tracks at Prince Charles’s Point precluded that approach to assessing the heteropody ratio. Heteropody was not calculated when manus tracks were overprinted or absent. Sauropod pes trackway gauges were classified based on trackway ratios (TR) as proposed by [64] (Eq 4) – in which side width (SW) was measured across an individual track, while overall width (OW) was measured between the outermost side width lines of respective pes tracks and perpendicular to the TMD (Fig 4C). The equation output a percentage value based on measurements taken perpendicular to the track midline for pes and manus tracks. The equation expanded on previous gauge designations by [68] to provide values that signify: wide below 35%, medium between 35-50% and narrow above 50%. Trackway gauge was further quantified through dividing WAP by pes length (PL) (Eq 5) or the width of manus angulation (WAM) by manus width (MW) (Eq 6) [58]. Pes gauge ratios could then be assessed as: narrow below 1.0, medium between 1.0-1.2, and wide above 1.2. Eq 5 also determined the extent to which pes tracks touched the TMD: overlaps midline below 1.0, and separated from midline above 1.0. The gauge difference and proximity of manus tracks to pes tracks to the track midline was determined by a WAP/WAM ratio (Eq 7) – signified as: further than pes below 1.0, and nearer than pes above 1.0. Gauge was also assessed according to [58] from ratios of WAP with the index of pes size (IPS) and/or WAM with the index of manus size (IMS) (Eqs 8-9). Due to the low number of sequential tracks per quadrupedal trackway, progression was used to determine the forward motion of a trackmaker in a single footfall for pes and manus tracks (Eqs 10-11). An estimated trackmaker hip height (h) was obtained by multiplying a track length (FL) by four in Eq 12 [69]. Hip height further informed velocity calculations. Velocity (V) was calculated per stride (three consecutive tracks as per [55]) (Eq 13). Average values of track length and stride across a trackway were used to calculate overall velocity and enabled comparison between trackways. The calculation utilised a trackway average stride length (λ), acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s^2) and average estimated hip height (h) (based on the mean FL per λ) [69]. An updated version of this equation, devised by [70], is also used (Eq 14). Stride length was furthermore divided by an estimated hip height to estimate trackmaker gait (Eq 15) sensu [71]. Gait values were approximated as: walking below 2.0, trotting between 2.0-2.9, and running above 2.9. Morphotype classification Both track metrics and morphology were used to group tracks into tracksite morphotypes (Fig 5). Tridactyl morphotypes were further subgrouped based on subtle differences and shared morphologies or metrics. Morphotype subgroups featured an additional letter added onto the end of each number. The main representative morphotype of the group was first, e.g., morphotype-1a. Each morphotype was compared with previously described ichnotaxa with similar metrics and morphologies to suggest a representative ichnotaxon and inform on possible trackmakers. Note outlines for morphotypes 1b and 2 are right pes tracks, the rest are left. Note outlines for morphotypes 1b and 2 are right pes tracks, the rest are left. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g005 Trackmaker orientations and palaeocurrent directions The orientations of tracks and flow directions (ripples) were digitally measured from the tracksite DEM. Track orientation categories included trackways, track associations, and isolated theropod tracks. Trackways and track associations were measured based on a midline. Isolated theropod track orientations were measured in the field from the length line. Flow directions were measured perpendicular to ripples around tracks (if visible). The steeper lee side of ripples represent forward flow directions [49]. Results Tracksite summary A total of 131 tracks were catalogued and preservation graded (65 theropods, 58 sauropods, 8 unidentified). Out of these tracks, 77 were measured, with 16 theropod and 27 sauropod tracks used to classify morphotypes (Fig 5). The tracks generally occur within or near two clusters, each in their own ‘section’ (Fig 6). UAV orthomosaic of full tracksite with Section One and Section Two divided accordingly by a dashed line. Track clusters in each section are highlighted in each by a yellow polygon. UAV orthomosaic of full tracksite with Section One and Section Two divided accordingly by a dashed line. Track clusters in each section are highlighted in each by a yellow polygon. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g006 In Section One, most tracks occur in a single horizon of bed 2 exposed as a partially boulder-covered, intertidal platform. A cluster of 17 (predominantly concave epirelief) theropod and 23 (shallow convex epirelief) sauropod tracks occur in a ~ 92 m2 clearing – as shown in our tracksite orthophoto (Fig 7). This includes morphotype-1a theropod track sequences ‘PC-TH-1 and 2’, associations ‘PC-TH-A-1 and 2’, and morphotype-2 sauropod trackways ‘PC-SA-1 and 2’. A trackway which includes an example of morphotype-1b (PC-TH-3) is situated 20.2 m north of the main track cluster and distantly surrounded by further isolated morphotype-1a and morphotype-2 tracks. Tracks impressed by an undetermined quadrupedal trackmaker, i.e., PC-U-A-1-66 to 67, PC-U-A-2-93 to 95, PC-U-A-3-96 to 97, and PC-U-A-4-98 to 100, were recorded in bed 5 below the ~ 92 m2 track accumulation. As most tracks in bed 5 have suffered considerable wear, they are not measured, figured or further described in this study. (A) In the orthophoto, the rippled sandstones of bed 2 gradually wear down toward the worn surface of bed 1 exposed toward the present-day high-tide mark due to a ~ 4° south-westerly dip. The orthophoto was composited from photographs taken by our UAV during fieldwork in April 2023. (B) The outline map highlights the position and distribution of tracks. Each track is labelled with its tracksite catalogue number. Trackways of ‘TH’ represent theropods, ‘SA’ signify sauropod, and ‘TH-A’ denote theropod track associations.

A cluster of 34 (mostly concave epirelief) theropod and 23 (shallow convex epirelief) sauropod tracks are present on a ~ 171 m2 area of intertidal platform – as shown in our tracksite orthophoto (Fig 8). These include morphotype-1a trackways ‘PC-TH-4 to 6’ and track associations ‘PC-TH-A-4 and 5’, amongst several isolated tracks. Morphotype-1d is solely represented by ‘PC-TH-A-3’. Morphotype-2 is most clearly represented by trackway ‘PC-SA-3’, alongside the worn and partial ‘PC-SA-4’ track sequence. Elsewhere, morphotype-1b is known from an isolated track (PC-TH-I-55) toward the northern end of Section Two. Morphotype-1c, represented by PC-TH-I-56 and 59, is present in the lower most bed 2 horizons to the south of the main Section Two cluster. Meanwhile, ‘PC-SA-5’, an isolated morphotype-2 trackway, represented at the northern end of the section is surrounded by sparsely distributed isolated morphotype-1a and 2 tracks. (A) In the orthophoto, extensive bed wear has revealed a variety of ripple wavelengths and bearings across multiple bed 2 horizons.

Track lengths typically range between 40-55 cm. Some phalangeal pad margins more discernible than others based on digit margins and configured up to a ‘2:3:4’ formula. Digit iv features a large, sub-circular metatarsophalangeal pad. Digit ii-iv divarication angles are generally between 40°-60°. Digit i is absent. A large, tridactyl footprint between 43.0-53.2 cm long and 28.0-38.1 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.22-1.66). Tracks are weakly-moderately mesaxonic (0.36-0.52) with broad, distally tapering digits. Digit margins are often parallel sided with anteriorly oriented, narrow, long ungual marks. Average digit iii/ii length ratios (1.24) are larger than digit iii/iv equivalents (0.81). Digits feature a clearly defined ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad formula (which include the shallowly impressed metatarsophalangeal pad on digit iv). Digit iv is the longest digit followed by digits iii and ii. Digit ii-iv divarication angles range between 44.0°-59.4° (average 51.1°). Morphotype-1a material description PC-TH-1 and 2 are the most diagnostic morphotype-1a trackways (Fig 9, Tables 3–8) and cross one another in Section One. Both exhibit similar trajectories with PC-TH-1 extending over 5.9 m at 47.5° relative to north and PC-TH-2 extending 6 m at 32.2° relative to north - against a south westerly flow direction implied by the ripples (219°). Each trackway is composed of five large tridactyl footprints. All except PC-TH-2-15 are in concave epirelief. PC-TH-1 tracks ranged in preservation grades between 0.5-2. PC-TH-2 preservation grades ranged between 1-1.5. Due to their incompleteness, PC-TH-1-06 and PC-TH-2-15 were not measured.

Unlike these tracks, PC-TH-I-01 was used to define morphotype-1a due to its clear digit margins, ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad formula, and sharp, elongated ungual marks.

PC-TH-1 track lengths vary between 43.0-45.8 cm (average 44.9 cm), while PC-TH-2 equivalents range between 43.1-47.7 cm (average 45.8 cm). Based on these track lengths, the estimated trackmaker hip height of PC-TH-1 (1.80 m) is almost identical to PC-TH-2 (1.83 m). The PC-TH-1 and 2 tracks also possess longer than wide l/w ratios (1.36-1.42 in PC-TH-1 and 1.42-1.66 in PC-TH-2). Although subtle, the digit ii-iv divarication angles are on average larger in PC-TH-1 (55.1°) than PC-TH-2 (51.2°). The distal region of digits ii-iii of PC-TH-1-08 appear to overprint into the lower margin of digit ii and heel region of PC-TH-2-12 (Fig 10B). This cross-cutting relationship and the presence of more clearly defined ripples within the PC-TH-2 track impressions suggests that the PC-TH-1 trackway was impressed slightly later than PC-TH-2. Their similar track margin definitions further imply that both trackways were likely impressed within a similar timeframe of one another. PC-TH-2-15 also overprints the worn displacement rim of sauropod track PC-SA-2-85 and further suggests the PC-TH-2 trackmaker traversed the lagoon margin soon after PC-SA-2 was registered and before PC-TH-1 was registered. These relationships demonstrate that the footprints in Section One are at least a little bit time-averaged and the trackmakers may not have crossed the same physical space at the same time. Both trackways also exhibit relatively consistent pace and stride lengths (Tables 5–6). On average, PC-TH-1 paced (1.40 m) and strode (2.90 m) similar distances to PC-TH-2, which paced at 1.48 m and strode at 2.93 m. The estimated velocities of PC-TH-1 are on average between 2.15-2.37 m/s (7.74-8.53 km/h) and very similar to that of PC-TH-2 at 2.11-2.34 m/s (7.60-8.42 km/h) (Tables 7–8). Overall, based on the gait parameters of [69], PC-TH-1 (1.62-1.66) and PC-TH-2 (1.58-1.64) both demonstrate walking gaits. Despite similarity in track morphology and velocity, both trackways are distinguished by contrasting WAP. The PC-TH-1 trackmaker overall paced at a much wider WAP (15.7-24.6 cm) than PC-TH-2 (4.3-6.8 cm). Regardless, both trackmakers are considered to have walked at a relatively narrow gauge. PC-TH-4 consists of eight large to giant-sized tracks, with seven clearly tridactyl, spanning over 12.2 m oriented 237° (Fig 11, Tables 9–11). All except PC-TH-4-23 are in concave epirelief. The tracks almost bear the same direction as palaeocurrents indicated by ripples (228.2°). Due to present-day erosion, tracks range from worn surface tracks to transmitted tracks and score low preservation grades between 0-1 (average 0.69). The overall lower preservation grade of this trackway may explain why length and width measurements appear larger than tracks with more crisply defined margins in PC-TH-1 and 2. Although the measurements of the PC-TH-4 tracks were not used to characterise morphotype-1a, the tracks were referred to the morphotype based on shared characteristics. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t010 Measurements such as low l/w ratios (1.24-1.41) and low-moderate mesaxony (0.39-0.53) are consistent with morphotype-1a (Table 9). Similarly, most digit ii-iv divarication angles are within the 40°-60° morphotype range (50.6°-57.2°), apart from PC-TH-4-26 (38.6°). Though phalangeal pads were difficult or impossible to distinguish within this trackway, faint digit margins indicate the tracks possessed broad digits with tapering, elongated ungual marks (Fig 12). Further morphotype-1a similarities include a declining digit length between digits iv to ii. The trackway exhibits relatively consistent pace (1.42-1.53 m) and stride (2.83-3.00 m) lengths, with generally subtly larger right pace angulations (161.2°-164.9°) than left equivalents (153.8°-161.5°) (Table 10). Right track WAPs meanwhile are generally smaller (19.0-24.1 cm) than left equivalents (24.1-33.5 cm). On average, the trackmaker exhibited a relatively steady walking gait (1.47) travelling between 1.90-2.10 m/s (6.84-7.56 km/h) (Table 11). PC-TH-5 is composed of ten large-giant sized tridactyl tracks, with an overall bearing of 7.2° over 15.2 m (Fig 13, Tables 12–14). All except PC-TH-5-38 and 39 are in concave epirelief. Track preservation grades are mostly between 0-1 due to poorly defined digit margins. As in PC-TH-4, track length and width appear subtly exaggerated. This exaggeration may have contributed to relatively low l/w ratios (Table 12). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t012 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t014 In contrast to most PC-TH-5 tracks, PC-TH-5-40 (preservation grade = 1.5) possesses clearly defined digit and phalangeal pad margins. PC-TH-5-40 was used to diagnose morphotype-1a while the remaining PC-TH-5 tracks were referred to morphotype-1a (Fig 14). The digit ii-iv divarication angle in most PC-TH-5 tracks were larger than those used to distinguish morphotype-1a, i.e., (53.7°-85.9°), possibly in part due to their eroded, more poorly defined margins, or a specific mode of locomotion. The largest interdigital angles were predominantly measured between digits iii-iv. The largest difference is recorded in PC-TH-5-37, which featured digits iii-iv angled at 51.2° and digits ii-iii at 18.6°. The trackway meanwhile exhibits natural fluctuations across an overall linear path (Table 13). Stride (2.34-2.89 m) and pace (1.30-1.58 m) exhibit greater ranges compared to other morphotype-1a trackways. These lengths appear to reduce between PC-TH-5-31 and 34 and increase thereafter. This fluctuation is therefore reflected in the stride/hip height ratio (1.46-1.18) and estimated velocities: 2.07-1.46 m/s = 7.45-5.26 km/h according to the equation in [69]; or 1.87-1.32 m/s = 6.73-4.75 km/h according to the equation in [70]. Regardless of velocity equation, the results highlight a walking gait (Table 14). PC-TH-A-4 is composed of two tridactyl tracks and extends over 3.41 m at 280.2° (Fig 15; S6 Fig, Table 15). PC-TH-A-4-49 is a shallow concave epirelief track with a preservation grade of 1.5. The track features well-defined digit margins, phalangeal pads, and ungual marks and was used to define morphotype-1a. The track features an enlarged heel region which extends its overall length to 53.2 cm, a 34.4 cm width, 1.55 l/w ratio and moderate mesaxony (0.50). These metrics, apart from l/w ratios, are subtly larger in PC-TH-A-4-50, which was not used to define morphotype-1a due to poorly defined digit margins toward the heel (preservation grade = 1). Despite this, the digit ii-iv divarication angle is larger in PC-TH-A-4-50 (59.5°) than PC-TH-A-4-49 (44.1°). In PC-TH-A-4-49, the digit ii-iii interdigital angle is unusually < 10° (5.9°). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t015 Most isolated tracks referred to morphotype-1a were generally incomplete or lacked clear margins. These tracks ranged in preservation grade between 0-2 (Fig 16, Table 16). Although isolated, such tracks are documented as they provide an indication of the number of theropod trackmakers, their varied directions, and close co-occurrences to sauropod trackmakers. PC-TH-I-46 occurs immediately ahead of the trajectory of sauropod trackway PC-SA-3 and bears 345° (Fig 16A-D). Unusually, a single unidentified bone is preserved within the heel region. PC-TH-I-16 occurs between the gauge margins of PC-SA-1 and bears 42° (Fig 16E-H). Exceptional tracks such as PC-TH-I-01 retain clear morphological detail and are used to define morphotype-1a (Fig 16I-L). PC-TH-I-01 bears 210° and is situated closest to the present-day high-tide mark in bed 2. The track is similarly preserved to some PC-TH-1 and 2 tracks with sharp, elongated ungual marks and ripples intruding the heel region. A ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad formula was discerned from a clear digit margin. The track is 46.3 cm long by 38.1 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.22) with a weak 0.38 mesaxony. The track features some of the most narrowly divaricated digits of the morphotype: digits ii-iii are divaricated by 18.0°, while digits iii-iv are 34.4° (total divarication angle 52.4°). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.t016 Another clearly preserved track is PC-TH-I-41 (Fig 16M-N, Table 16). PC-TH-I-41 is a convex epirelief tridactyl track which bears 282° and scores a preservation grade of 2. As a large boulder covered the anterior portion of the track during later fieldwork, a photogrammetric model could not be produced. Despite this, approximate track measurements were taken from photographs. The track metrics occupy the extreme ranges of morphotype-1a and include a ~ 41.2 cm length and ~ 34.8 cm width (l/w ratio 1.18) with a 0.41 mesaxony and digit ii-iv divarication angle of ~ 58.7°. Like morphotype-1a, PC-TH-I-41 features clearly defined phalangeal pads and long ungual marks and digits with sharp margins. The lateral digits however feature sigmoidal curvature. Pad Piv1 furthermore is poorly defined. Morphotype-1b Material – PC-TH-3-20, PC-TH-I-55 (Figs 17 and 18A-D; Table 17). (A) Textured orthophoto, (B) outline, (C) contour, (D) DEM.

Digits are broad and lack metatarsophalangeal pads. Digit i is inconsistently preserved. – i.e., phalangeal pads and ungual marks may be present. Digit ii and iv lengths are generally subequal in length. The digit ii-iv divarication angle is > 65°. A large tridactyl track, between 41.8-43.3 cm long and 32.7-33.3 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.26-1.32). Tracks are moderately mesaxonic (0.51-0.53) with moderately slender, distally tapering digits and narrow, long ungual marks. Digit margins are generally linear. Digits could possess clear phalangeal pad margins and subtly anterolateral oriented ungual marks. Tracks can possess a ‘X:2:3:3’ phalangeal pad formula. Digit iii is the longest digit. A digit i ungual mark may be present and laterally directed opposite a posterolaterally oriented subtriangular heel region. The digit ii-iv divarication angle ranges between 73.5°-75.7°. Morphotype-1b material description PC-TH-I-55 represents the clearest example of morphotype-1b, with a preservation grade of 1.5. Metrically, the track is distinguished by its low l/w ratio (1.26), moderate mesaxony (0.51), and pronounced acute divarication angle (75.7°) (Table 17). Morphologically, the track is distinguished from other morphotype-1 subgroup by lacking a digit iv metatarsophalangeal pad and featuring a anteromedially directed, triangular shaped digit i ungual mark impression (Fig 17). A second morphotype-1b track, PC-TH-3-20, forms a part of the PC-TH-3 trackway as discussed below. PC-TH-3 is an isolated trackway which extends over 4.93 m at 311.14° and is composed of four tracks – including a single morphotype-1b track (Figs 18, S9). Shales appear to obscure most of PC-TH-3-21. Due to the occurrence of incomplete tracks, trackway measurements were omitted. Although most tracks score low preservation grades (0-0.5), a single complete track diagnosed as morphotype-1b, PC-TH-3-20, is graded 1.5. The track measures 43.3 cm long by 32.7 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.32) with a 0.53 mesaxony. Like PC-TH-I-55, the digit iii-iv interdigital angle (44.5°) is greater than digit ii-iii (29.0°). Morphologically, the track possesses an extensive ‘U’ shaped heel region (Fig 18A-D). Although part of the same trackway as PC-TH-3-20, PC-TH-3-19 and PC-TH-3-22 morphologically differ with isolated digits and no digit i impression (Fig 18E-H). Due to this, while these tracks reflect characteristics of an alternative morphotype like morphotype-1c, they are unreferred. Their presence within this trackway suggests a single trackmaker could produce multiple track shapes. Morphotype-1c Material – PC-TH-I-56, 59 (Fig 19, Table 18). From left to right, textured orthophoto, outline, contour map, and DEM. (A-D) PC-TH-I-56 was the only recorded concave epirelief morphotype-1c track. The track is situated in a slightly younger bed 2 horizon behind an igneous intrusion.

Digits are slenderer with sub-parallel margins which taper toward narrow, subtriangular ungual marks. The digit iv metatarsophalangeal pad is not well defined. Digit ii-iv divarication angles are > 60°. A large, tridactyl footprint between 30.6-32.1 cm long and 26.3-28.4 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.13-1.16). Mesaxony varies between 0.36-0.50. Digits are moderately slender with sub-parallel margins and distally tapered to narrow, long anteriorly-oriented ungual marks. Digit iv is subtly longer than digit iii, while digit ii is the shortest digit. Digit length ratios on average differ slightly from morphotype-1a; digit iii/ii (1.22) and digit iii/iv (0.89). Vague phalangeal pad margins exhibit a ‘2:3:4’ formula. Wide digit ii-iv divarication angles measure between 63.8°-77.0°. Morphotype-1c material description Morphotype-1c is known from two isolated tracks which occur in the lower portion of bed 2 (Fig 19, Table 18). PC-TH-I-56 is the only known concave epirelief morphotype-1c track and occurs in a slightly younger rippled bed 2 horizon than PC-TH-I-59 (Fig 19A-D). Due to wear, the track scores a preservation grade of 1.5. The shallowly convex epirelief PC-TH-I-59 features clear digit and phalangeal pad margins and scores a preservation grade of 2. The track is situated in an older bed 2 horizon which directly overlies the topmost, desiccated bed 1 horizon (Fig 19E-H). In the same horizon, PC-TH-I-65, a partial track, is referred to the morphotype because it possesses similar digit slenderness, narrow tapering digits, and subtle sigmoidal curvature to PC-TH-I-59 (Fig 19I-J). The track is partially metamorphosed on the edge of the wave cut platform. Morphotype-1d Material – PC-TH-A-3-47, 48 (Fig 20, Table 19). (A) Photograph cropped to model area, (B) DEM, (C) outline of PC-TH-A-3. Although characterised by a smaller < 30 cm overall length, the tracks of PC-TH-A-3 are classified under morphotype-1 due to a similar average l/w ratio (1.46), < 60° digit ii-iv divarication angle, and ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad configuration to morphotype-1a. From left to right, photographs, outline, contour map, and DEM of (D-G) PC-TH-A-3-47 and (H-K) PC-TH-A-4-48. Although worn, PC-TH-A-4-48 features clear phalangeal pad creases on digit ii. The creases of Piv1 and Piii3 are also visible. (A) Photograph cropped to model area, (B) DEM, (C) outline of PC-TH-A-3.

Digits are slenderer, shorter in length, with smaller, narrow ungual marks. Phalangeal pads are typically longer than wide and ovular/subcircular in shape. A medium-sized, tridactyl track between 26.3-27.6 cm long by 17.6-19.4 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.42-1.49). Mesaxonic indices are moderate (0.51-0.56). Digits are moderately slender with straight margins, gradually shortening distally toward short, narrow anteriorly-oriented ungual marks. The digit iii/ii ratio (1.43) is larger than its digit iii/iv equivalent (0.96). A ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad formula was distinguished through bulges on digit margins or weakly defined interdigital creases. The pads are typically longer than wide and ovular/subcircular in shape. Digit ii-iv divarication angles are < 60° (53.7°-58.3°). Morphotype-1d material description PC-TH-A-3 is composed of two shallow convex epirelief tridactyl tracks – the only representatives of morphotype-1d (Fig 20, Table 19). The tracks are situated in bed 2 in Section Two, bear 87.7°, with preservation grades of 1.5. PC-TH-A-3-47 is a right track, while PC-TH-A-3-48 is a left track. Compared to PC-TH-A-3-47, PC-TH-A-3-48 features a larger digit iii-iv interdigital angle (33.6°) over digits ii-iii (24.7°). In PC-TH-A-3-47, the digit ii-iii interdigital angle is almost identical to PC-TH-A-3-48 (24.5°), while its digit iii-iv interdigital angle (29.2°) is smaller than that of PC-TH-A-3-48. PC-TH-A-4-48 furthermore features faintly defined interdigital creases on digit ii and pads Piv1 and Piii3. Based on track length, the represented trackmaker stood at ~ 1.08 m to the hip. Across the visible track association, the trackmaker paced 89.7 cm. Morphotype-1 ichnotaxonomy Ichnotaxonomically, despite differences in overall track length, morphotype-1 is metrically and morphologically most like Megalosauripus [72]. Megalosauripus is functionally tridactyl with an elongate ‘heel’, i.e., the digit iv metatarsophalangeal pad (Piv1), and features weak-moderate l/w ratios (~1.2) and mesaxonic indices (0.40) and digit ii-iv divarication angles < 70° [72–73]. Megalosauripus furthermore possesses a ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad digit configuration and broad to moderately slender digits with elongated, sharp ungual marks [59,73]. The phalangeal pads themselves are often sub-circular or oval-shaped and longer than wide [72]. Morphotypes 1a and d possess all these characteristics. In the Cleveland Basin, Yorkshire, UK, ‘morphotype Bxviii’ was likened by [74–75] to Megalosauripus isp. due to its relatively low l/w ratios (1.24-1.34) and digit ii-iv divarication angles (45°-70°). In Portugal, [76] described ~ 80 Megalosauripus-like tracks with similar l/w ratios (1.24-1.39) and interdigital angles < 40° (22°-40°). Further morphotype-1 similarities to Megalosauripus include large obtuse pace angulations in trackways, which overlap with the 140°-160° range proposed by [77]. Megalosauripus uzbekistanicus tracks also feature similar pace angulation ranges of 125°-175° [72]. Similarly weak l/w ratios and mesaxonic indices were reported in the Late Jurassic Jurabrontes curtedulensis [59], which differ from morphotype-1 with bulkier, tear-drop shaped digits. The Late Jurassic Iberosauripus grandis is similar to Jurabrontes but differs with bulkier digits [78]. Other similar ichnotaxa include the Early Jurassic Eubrontes giganteus, which possess l/w ratios (1.40-1.50) and mesaxonic indices (0.58) within the range of some morphotype-1 tracks [61,79]. However, unlike Eubrontes, morphotype-1 possesses parallel-sided digit margins (not spindle-shaped) and a ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad formula (instead of ‘3:3:4’) [72]. Although most morphotype-1 tracks are characterised by digit ii-iv divarication angles < 60°, some like morphotype-1c, possess subtly slenderer digits and larger divarication angles like the Early Jurassic Kayentapus. Type tracks from North America reassessed by [32] from [80] possessed a subtly broader ~ 63° digit ii-iv divarication angle. These higher divarication angles contribute to low l/w ratios [79]. Morphotype-1 tracks with large digit ii-iv divarication angles > 70°, such as those of PC-TH-5, could reflect a subtle change in substrate composition or locomotion. Type Kayentapus tracks are further distinguished from morphotype-1 by generally slenderer, more digitigrade digits, with a detached or unimpressed Piv1 [81]. Morphotype-1c, although ~ 30 cm in length, is more similar in digit thickness and length to Megalosauripus isp. tracks reported from Portugal and Morocco – particularly morphotype 2c [72,82]. In contrast to most morphotype-1 tracks, morphotype-1b additionally possesses a subtriangular tapering heel region, with an anteromedially oriented digit i ungual mark on PC-TH-I-55 (Fig 17). These morphologies resemble those of the Early Cretaceous Bueckeburgichnus maximus [83]. However, rather than decrease in thickness between digits ii-iv, PC-TH-I-55 differs from Bueckeburgichnus maximus with relatively uniform digit slenderness. Furthermore, like Megalosauripus, oval-shaped and longer than wide phalangeal pads are present across digits ii-iv rather than in digit ii alone in Bueckeburgichnus maximus. The morphotype-1b characters more closely resemble type ichnospecies Megalosauripus tracks (Megalosauripus uzbekistanicus) identified by [73], which could also possess phalangeal pads, a heel impression and digit i ungual impression. These morphologies of morphotype-1b, in addition to its shorter digit lengths and wide digit ii-iv divarication angles compared to morphotype-1a, may have arisen due to deeper foot penetration into a softer substrate [84]. The extended heel impression on PC-TH-3-20, which resembles Bueckeburgichnus maximus, may have registered due to moderate sediment saturation. This is emphasised by large, shallow posterior displacement rims. These extend across a larger area compared to anterior displacement rims (Fig 18A-D). This may emphasise the longer duration to which the autopodia remained in contact with the sediment upon registration and a subtle posterior slide when removed sensu [85]. Overall, morphotype-1 is considered Megalosauripus isp. due to the possession of parallel-sided digit margins, broad digits, weak-moderate l/w ratios and mesaxony, and ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad formula. The impression of digit i in type Megalosauripus tracks and morphotype-1b demonstrates the variability of tracks, potentially due to substrate conditions. The presence of tracks with similar morphologies and divarication angles larger than typical Megalosauripus tracks, i.e., morphotype-1c and referred morphotype-1a tracks, may reflect on substrate or behaviour. Although morphotype-1c-d are smaller than typical Megalosauripus tracks, their possession of previously mentioned Megalosauripus-like metrics and morphology cannot be ignored.

Digit i is typically oriented anteromedially or anterolaterally in the opposite direction to subtle anterolateral digits ii-iv. Manus tracks lack non-pollex digits and possess a subtle posterolaterally subtriangular, tapering pollex. Track rotations rarely exceed 40°. Trackways are narrow to medium gauged. Small-medium sized oval/subtriangular shaped pes tracks between 46.4-56.9 cm in length and 33.9-42.4 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.22-1.58) with an IPS between 39.7-47.8. Tracks are asymmetrical and anteriorly widen from rounded heels. The widest width was measured across the anterior third of the track. Most pes tracks are outwardly rotated from the stride line (10.7°-48.5°). Digits and ungual marks i-iv are subtriangular in shape and rarely observed. The pedal and heel pads are also rarely observed. Each is separated by a shallow ‘s’ shaped heel-demarcating crease when visible. Manus tracks measured between 17.0-26.2 cm long and 32.8-41.6 cm wide (l/w ratio 0.47-0.66) with an IMS between 23.6-33.0. Tracks are asymmetric, crescentic, and lack digits (except for a posterolaterally tapering pollex). Almost all tracks are outwardly orientated at greater angles than pes equivalents (14.6°-43.7°). On average, outward manus rotations (24.5°) are shallower than pes equivalents (31.3°). Morphotype-2 material description Eight visible manus/pes pairs, and an additionally isolated pes, make up a 12.4 m long trackway overall bearing 37.9° against a 226° flow-direction indicated by ripples (Fig 21, Tables 21–24). Due to the south westerly bed dip, bed 1 is gradually exposed toward the present-day high tide mark as bed 2 appears more eroded. As a result, the track margin definition declines (preservation grades = 0-1.5). Tracks are surrounded by large, shallow convex epirelief displacement rims which are variably scoured by present-day erosion. Uneroded displacement rims are shallowly mounded with ripples, while track surfaces are unrippled. Pes tracks are on average 52.8 cm long by 38.9 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.36), with an IPS of 45.3. Based on track length, the trackmaker may have possessed an estimate hip height of ~ 2.11 m. Tracks are oval/subtriangular in shape and widest subtly anterior of the long axis midpoint. Although most tracks lack digits and pads, four anterolaterally oriented worn digits (i-iv) and faint ungual marks (ii-iv only) are present on PC-SA-1-82 (Fig 22). Although visible, due to erosion, the orientation of digit i could not be determined. The heel pad on PC-SA-1-82 is separated from the pedal impression by a heel-demarcating crease. Manus tracks are on average 21.9 cm long by 38.4 cm wide with an IMS of 29.0. Though clearly defined, manus tracks (like PC-SA-1-79) lack non-pollex digits and correspondent ungual marks. Most possess a posterolaterally-directed, subtriangular pollex (Fig 23). Paired manus and pes tracks possess an average heteropody ratio of 1:1.56. Due to poorly defined track margins, the gauge could only be measured between PC-SA-1-82 and 78. Between these three tracks, the gauge is narrow-medium (40.2-50.1%) (Table 22). This contributes to the overall trackway asymmetry. This is further emphasised by the variation of pes and manus track positions. Manus centres can be positioned slightly outside (e.g., PC-SA-1-80 and 84) or inside (e.g., PC-SA-1-78 and 82) of corresponding extended pes long axes. Despite this, manus tracks are predominantly further away from the track midline than pes equivalents (average WAP/WAM ratio = 0.60). Track rotations fluctuate throughout the sequence and are on average subequal between pes (27.5°) and manus tracks (28.5°). Right pes rotations from PC-SA-1-82 decrease, while left equivalents fluctuate and remain consistently outwardly rotated. The PC-SA-1-73 manus is the only recorded inwardly rotated track in the sequence (Table 23). Left (2.35-2.87 m) and right (2.60-2.75 m) pes strides both increase up to PC-SA-1-74, when the right stride declines to 2.43 m. Paces from left tracks are larger (1.33-1.97 m) than respectively subsequent right equivalents (1.24-1.42 m) in sequence. Likewise, left-right track progressions are larger (1.21-1.69 m) than vice versa (1.02-1.24 m). These asymmetrical patterns may reflect natural fluctuations in the trackmaker path. The average trackway velocity estimates (1.45-1.61 m/s = 5.22-5.80 km/h) and stride/hip height ratio (1.23) overall indicate a walking gait (Table 24). Four pes and two partially overprinted manus tracks make up a 3.4 m long trackway bearing 311.2° (Fig 24, Table 25). Most tracks feature displacement rims. The clearest is mounded and rippled and surrounds PC-SA-2-85 (Fig 25D-E). The concave epirelief right pes tracks are more clearly defined than the shallow convex epirelief left equivalents. Overall, tracks score preservation grades between 0-1. Pes tracks are on average 53.4 cm long by 39.4 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.36), with an IPS of 45.9. Tracks are ovular and widest subtly anterior of the long axis midpoint. Although most pes tracks lack digits, four worn digits are visible on PC-SA-2-85. PC-SA-2-88 is in concave epirelief and may have been impressed with emphasis on the left side of the foot as the heel pad appears more deeply registered into the sediment than the rest of the track. Although measured, the visible right manus tracks were overprinted by correspondent pes and do not reflect the true track length. Based on other trackways at Prince Charles’s Point, PC-SA-2 could be incomplete as two possible pes tracks may have occupied the large space between PC-SA-2-87 and 88. Due to this, trackway measurements are not taken. The sauropod is estimated to have a ~ 2.14 m hip height. PC-SA-3 consists of eight sequential shallow convex epirelief pes tracks and two manus tracks bearing 330° over 5.2 m (Figs 25, Tables 26–28). Across the sequence, pes tracks gradually become rounded and score lower preservation grades (between 0.5-1.5). Manus tracks were overprinted by the corresponding pes and are not measured (preservation grades = 0.5). Pes tracks are on average 50.1 cm long by 36.7 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.37) with an IPS of 42.9. Tracks are variably ovular and widest across the anterior third of the long axis. Each is surrounded by large, often scoured displacement rims. The displacement rim surrounding PC-SA-3-111 is one of the most uneroded at the locality and is mounded with clear ripples across the surface. Like other tracks in PC-SA-3, the displacement rim is widest and in most relief laterally to the track. PC-SA-3-111 is also the only pes to feature clearly defined, subtriangular, anterolaterally oriented digits (i-iv) in the trackway (Fig 26). These digits decrease in size toward digit iv like PC-SA-1-82. Manus tracks, meanwhile, are difficult to distinguish due to pes overprinting. As a result, the measurements do not reflect the true track dimensions and heteropody estimation is omitted for this trackway. An estimated hip height of ~ 2.01 m is inferred from pes track length. The quadrupedal trackway is characterised by a narrow to marginal medium gauge by trackway ratios between 46.2-54.6% (Table 27). These gauges are emphasised by pes tracks mostly overlapping the track midline as WAP/PL ratios range between 0.84-1.05. Left pes track rotations gradually decline across the sequence (35.7°-17.1°) while right equivalents fluctuate (34.3°-27.2°). The 17.1° from PC-SA-3-102 is based on the projection of the PC-SA-3-105 stride. Unlike PC-SA-1, the low track rotation ranges contributed to a minimalised track asymmetry. This is also reflected in the low variation in stride (1.40-1.59 m), pace (0.78-0.97 m), and progression (0.60-0.80 m). Right pes track paces (0.84-0.97 m) and progression (0.67-0.80 m) consistently decline in between fluctuations in left paces (0.78-0.91 m) and progression (0.60-0.80). The estimated average trackmaker velocity estimates (0.63-0.69 m/s = 2.27-2.48 km/h) and stride/hip height ratio (0.76) signify a slow walking gait (Table 28). PC-SA-3-109 track lengths were omitted due to obstruction by a boulder. Track length (L) was measured in cm. Hip height (h) and stride (λ) were measured in m. Velocity was measured in m/s. AX velocity follows [69], while RT velocity follows [70]. Situated on a narrow exposure of bed 2 before the main Section Two track cluster, PC-SA-5 is composed of at least three consecutive pes tracks (Fig 27, Table 29). The trackway spans 2 m bearing 328.4°. Further tracks may be present before PC-SA-5-127. However, these hints of sedimentary features have margins too poorly defined to confidently confirm. Due to the exposure of multiple ripple horizons, track margins become progressively poorly defined and score preservation grades between 0.5-1.5. As a result, trackway measurements were not taken, and a precise horizon of origin could not be determined. Despite this, large partial or complete shallow convex epirelief displacement rims surround each track. PC-SA-5-127 and 128 feature sufficient margin definition to be measured and described. On average, the tracks measure 53.5 cm long by 40.1 cm wide (l/w ratio 1.33) with an IPS of 46.3. Both tracks are ovular in shape and anteriorly widen. PC-SA-5-127 is the only track to feature four clearly defined subtriangular digits. Digit i is anterolaterally oriented in the opposite direction to digits ii-iv (Fig 28). Tapering ungual marks are most visible on digits i-ii. Faint, shallow convex epirelief heel and pedal impressions are also distinguished. An estimated hip height of ~ 2.14 m was interpolated from track length. Morphotype-2 discussion Morphotype-2 is inferred to have been made by a sauropod trackmaker based on the following synapomorphies: quadrupedal trackways, relatively digitigrade pes and manus posture, four entaxonic, semi-circularly arranged digits with ungual marks on pes tracks, and vertically oriented metacarpals that do not therefore leave impressions but impart an overall crescent shape to a pronated/semi-tubularly arranged manus track [86–90]. In contrast to morphotype-2, quadrupedal tracks made by Middle Jurassic stegosaurs described by [91] were smaller with a tridactyl pes (digit iii is the most pronounced digit) and a narrower crescentic manus with a pronounced pollex. Morphotype-2 pes tracks feature comparable morphologies to a non-neosauropod or basal eusauropod. These include a prominently impressed digit i, sickle-shaped digits ii-iii, and comparatively smaller digit iv [88–90]. Although the digits can taper and are anterolaterally oriented, their relatively low pronation contrasts with the synapomorphic pronounced curvature observed on more derived neosauropod tracks [88]. Additional similarities to eusauropods include: an anteriorly widening pes with a horizontally held and spread-out metatarsus and clearly defined heel impression [87,88,92]. Most eusauropod manus metacarpals form shallowly concave posterior margins rather than the tightly bunched metacarpal colonnades of arched ‘U’ shaped equivalents of derived neosauropods [86,93,94]. This is especially apparent on morphotype-2 manus tracks, which are shallowly crescentic. Like most eusauropods and some basal neosauropods (which included diplodocoids and basal macronarians), the pollex of morphotype-2 manus tracks are the only visible digit with a pronounced ungual mark [86,95]. Large pollex ungual marks were also identified by [37] in sauropod manus tracks from the nearby Duntulm Formation at Cairidh Ghlumaig (Duntulm). The tracks contrast the smaller or absent pollex ungual mark of the titanosauriform manus [96]. Morphotype-2 pes sequences are predominantly narrow-medium gauge with an average trackway ratio of 47.1%. Wider gauge trackways are typically associated with Titanosauriformes – sauropods which may have originated, or at least most thoroughly diversified, in the Late Jurassic [68,89]. Despite its medium gauges, the tracks of PC-SA-1 feature similar dimensions and track morphologies present in narrower gauged trackways at Prince Charles’s Point, i.e., PC-SA-3. This suggests that a likely single, non-neosauropod or basal neosauropod trackmaker species may have been capable of leaving multiple trackway gauges. This variation could be due to individual behaviour or dimorphism [63]. Many of the morphotype-2 morphologies are present in tracks assigned as ‘Breviparopus-like/Parabrontopodus-like’ as per [37,97]. These characteristics include shallowly crescentic manus tracks with a large pollex ungual mark: similar to tracks identified as Breviparopus from the Middle Jurassic of Morocco [98; Fig 9.5]; and Parabrontopodus from the Late Jurassic of North America [66]. Undiagnosed manus tracks from Yorkshire described by [99] also featured these morphologies. Morphotype-2 pes tracks meanwhile occupy the lower ~ 50 cm range of either ichnotaxon [66,100]. The tracks additionally anteriorly widen and feature four anterolaterally oriented digits and ungual marks. Although most pes tracks lack digits, [63] suggested the classification of equivalent tracks in Late Jurassic shallow marine carbonate platform sediments in Switzerland was appropriate as some diagnosed Breviparopus or Parabrontopodus trackways featured tracks without digits. Like the type Breviparopus and Parabrontopodus trackways, morphotype-2 equivalents are predominantly narrow-medium gauged, although are characterised by a lower average heteropody. Overall, morphotype-2 most resembles equivalent Middle Jurassic Breviparopus/Parabrontopodus-like morphotypes, such as Ai-Aii from the Cleveland Basin, Yorkshire, England [99,101]. Discussion Summary Prince Charles’s Point provides evidence for a dinosaur assemblage, which includes large theropods and sauropods, that likely traversed across a locally, shallowly submerged lagoon margin of variable substrate composition in the Late Bathonian on Skye. A further undetermined quadrupedal trackmaker is represented separately in bed 5 and evidences the occurrence of dinosaurs across multiple beds. The overall variation in the preservation of tracks within trackways also indicates variable substrate conditions despite present-day erosion and burial soon after impression. The slow gaits of both theropod and sauropod trackmakers and variability in the preferred direction of travel further suggests cumulative milling behaviour [102]. Assemblage comparison At Prince Charles’s Point, we recorded 63 large theropod pes tracks over 56 sauropod manus and pes – in this case representing a greater abundance of large theropod trackmakers. Middle Jurassic aged theropod-dominated assemblages such as this are rare across much of Europe and North America [32,34,35,38,76,96,103,104]. A previously described assemblage in the Kilmaluag Formation at Lùb Score contrasts with an abundance of tiny-medium sized (<30 cm long) theropod tracks [35]. At Prince Charles’s Point, only two medium-sized tracks are known (PC-TH-A-3-47 and 48). Given the short duration of substrate exposure, the absence of tiny-medium sized tracks and dominance of large theropods and sauropods could reflect a census of the most locally abundant dinosaurs [105]. Although both localities are considered lagoon margins, the hypothesised occurrence of post-hatchling care at Lùb Score by [35], may reflect closer proximity to more suitable habitat for such behaviour and the inhabitation of smaller theropods than at Prince Charles’s Point. The assemblage composition thus may have been influenced by the idiosyncratic needs of each clade that was present. The brackish lagoonal, rippled sandstones of the Duntulm Formation at An Corran meanwhile have thus far mostly yielded large theropod tracks [34]. Morphologically, like morphotype-1a (and European and North American examples of Megalosauripus), the tracks possess broad, parallel-sided digits with a ‘2:3:4’ phalangeal pad formula. Metrically, the average length (44.2 cm) and digit ii-iv divarication angles (52°) overlap with the ranges of morphotype-1a. The shorter trackways also reached similar pace angulations up to 180°. A single small sized tridactyl track was further recorded from An Corran [101]. Like Prince Charles’s Point, the track-bearing surface was likely shallowly submerged as it is rippled and lacks desiccation and radial cracks. In the same formation, a single large theropod track is recorded from the sauropod-dominated assemblage at Cairidh Ghlumaig – composed of similar ‘Breviparopus-Parabrontopodus-like’ tracks to Prince Charles’s Point [37,106; Fig 27]. In the Lealt Shale Formation of Rubha nam Bràithrean (BP2), several poorly preserved large theropod tracks with parallel sided digit margins and weak l/w ratios like morphotype-1a and Megalosauripus constitute approximately 10% of the tracks [38]. These are recorded in the same horizon of brackish lagoonal sediment as more abundant sauropod tracks [38]. Similar theropod tracks are also recorded in horizons of Lealt Shale Formation at BP1 and BP3 which represent periods of subaerial exposure [32]. When compared to Rubha nam Bràithrean (BP2) [38] and Cairidh Ghlumaig [37], the balance of trackmakers at Prince Charles’s Point is strikingly different with a greater abundance of theropod tracks over sauropods. The track-bearing horizons across the three localities reflect lagoonal settings and provide little indication of subaerial exposure. However, there appears to be salinity differences between these lagoonal settings, possibly due to their location within the broader and dynamic coastal palaeoenvironment [45]. At Prince Charles’s Point, the lagoonal palaeoenvironment within the Kilmaluag Formation was influenced by freshwater sources [6,40], while the Lealt Shale and Duntulm Formations at BP2 and Cairidh Ghlumaig evidence more brackish/marine influences [6,107,108]. Speculatively, the difference in trackmaker balance between Prince Charles’s Point and other localities with in-situ sauropod tracks might arise from the substrate or palaeoenvironmental preferences of different dinosaur clades. Despite these differences in trackmaker assemblage, the takeaways of other Scottish in-situ localities remain consistent: sauropods frequently spent time in lagoonal palaeoenvironments along with large-bodied theropods [37–38]. In contrast, it is unclear whether the absence of ornithopods and thyreophorans at Prince Charles’s Point reflects genuine absence or preservation bias. Their presence in the subaerially exposed mudflat sediments of Rubha nam Bràithrean (BP3), described by [32], may suggest that these groups favoured these environments more than shoreline lagoons, although we must be mindful of interpreting such small numbers of tracks. Elsewhere, similar theropod and sauropod morphotypes, Bxviii and Ai-Aiii respectively, are reported from ex-situ blocks of carbonate mudflat sediment in the Cleveland basin [75,99,109]. These bear similar morphologies to the Prince Charles’s Point tracks (see morphotype ichnotaxonomy sections) and are respectively classified as Megalosauripus isp. and Breviparopus isp. [101]. Despite their presence, smaller theropod and ornithopod morphotypes are recorded in greater abundance along much of the north Yorkshire coast [109]. Bathonian aged sediments in Ardley, Oxfordshire, UK, preserve multiple extensive theropod and sauropod trackways across an emergent/shallowly submerged, carbonate mudflat surface [96]. Although identified as Megalosauripus, the tracks are > 50 cm in length (larger than morphotype-1). The sauropod tracks are also much larger and are referred to Titanosauriforms – currently not known from the Inner Hebrides. In Portugal, similarly aged, sized, divaricated, and padded Megalosauripus tracks are found within bimodially oriented trackways on a tidal mudflat surface [76]. Based on this comparison, the dinosaur tracks at Prince Charles’ Point are generally consistent with the broader global context. These fit into a bigger global story that appears to show a preference for both sauropods and megalosaurid theropods in more marginal, coastal environments on the basis of their footprints. This pattern could either be due to the higher preservation potential of these environments or genuine trackmaker preferences. Trackmaker behaviour The lagoonal margin at Prince Charles’s Point hosted several theropod and sauropod individuals, as evidenced by their tracks and trackways. All bear multiple directions (Fig 29A, Table 30) and lack evidence of gregarious behaviour, i.e., parallel, or structurally spaced trackways [110–112]. Such wide directional variation, coupled with walking gaits, is often attributed to milling behaviour [102]. As evidenced by trackways such as PC-TH-1 and 2, coupled with relatively sharp track definition and lack of invertebrate bioturbation, this behaviour appears time averaged over a short period prior to burial. Similar time averaged milling behaviour has also been observed at other Great Estuarine Group tracksites [32,37,38]. (A) Trackmaker and (B) ripple orientations. Classifications include: theropod trackways (TH), theropod track associations (TH-A) isolated theropod tracks (TH-I), sauropod trackways (SA), and sauropod track associations (SA-A).

Ripple orientations were measured opposite respective tracks when present.

In the track-bearing horizons of beds 2 and 5, the ripple orientations opposite tracks predominantly indicated south westerly flow directions (210.5°-230.8°). Occasional southerly (~179°) and south easterly (~143°-159°) flow directed horizons generally lacked tracks. This implies that trackmakers were not constrained by local topography, i.e., shoreline position [111,113]. Despite this, it is noteworthy that no tracks bearing directly south or in southeasterly directions have been recorded. Interestingly, horizons with large ripple wavelengths that lack tracks feature southeasterly flow-directed ripples. A deeper water source could have existed to the southeast of the tracksite. While it is possible to speculate why these trackmakers used the lagoon, such as for food or shelter, there is currently no evidence to support specific usages. Interpretation of sauropod tracks The unusual shallow relief of the Prince Charles’s Point sauropod tracks have led previous geologists observing these structures to hypothesise various non-track explanations for their size and shape. Andrews first recognised the tracks as ‘circular obstacle marks’ within his locality sediment log [40]. Obstacle marks are flow-induced structures which form on sediment surfaces when current eddies become trapped and cause the substrate surface to be scoured around or ahead of an anchored object [114–115]. Andrews later amended this hypothesis and stated that the low energy conditions present in the lagoon would unlikely instigate “turbulent eddy scour-pool excavations” under any large boulder [39; pp. 249]. Andrews then proceeded to provide an extended description of the ‘circular impressions’ and described them as: “platelike structures about 50 cm in diameter, which are found on wave-rippled sandstone” [39; pp. 249]. Andrews suggested four alternative formation mechanisms: scour marks induced by plant remains, jelly fish traces, animal footprints, or fish resting/burrow traces. Andrews considered fish resting/burrow traces as the most likely explanation, as he described them as most comparable in structure and shape to modern mudskipper burrows described by [116]. These burrows were reported to be 20-45 cm in diameters with narrow embankments between 5-10 cm. Andrews, however, noted the absence of mudskippers until the Oligocene and suggested an unknown fish species was responsible [39]. Known burrowing freshwater/low salinity fish, such as lungfish, produce long tubular and ovular subsurface concavities [39,117]. Although circular in cross-section, the widest lungfish burrow diameters are typically < 15 cm [118–119]. Andrews rejected an ‘animal footprint’ interpretation, stating: “the shallow, regular shape of these circular structures is not consistent with the footprints of a heavy animal; neither is there any predictable sequence of depressions, which might be expected in a trackway” [39; pp. 249]. Andrews also commented that “nine of these structures were seen within an area of about 10 m2 (the limit of bedding plane exposure)”. Based on this description, [39] most likely described the sedimentary structures we describe as the PC-SA-3 trackway (Fig 25). Contrary to Andrews’s observations, PC-SA-3 and other diagnosed sauropod trackways are composed of a continuous alternating left-right sequences of oval-subtriangular shaped, anteriorly widening, asymmetric pes tracks – some with digits. The asymmetry is also consistent with a single direction of movement. The lack of un-overprinted elliptical/crescentic manus tracks with a pollex in PC-SA-3, as observed in other trackways (e.g., PC-SA-1), may have contributed to the initial diagnosis. The track figured in [39; Fig 2] may presently suffer from erosion but could feature digits (S10 Fig). All these details are more apparent to us than they were to Andrews because our site drone imagery allows the spatial relationships of the tracks to be viewed from an aerial perspective. Unlike previously recorded sauropod tracks in the Great Estuarine Group, the Prince Charles’s Point sauropod tracks are shallower with wide displacement rims and are in convex epirelief. Similar tracks have been described in the lagoonal/sabkha Middle Jurassic Iouaridène Formation of Morocco [98] and lagoonal Lower Cretaceous Broome Sandstone [120–121]. [120; pp. 5] attributed similar track morphology to “the physical properties of the substrate and the size and behaviour of the trackmaker.” Sediment properties included grain size, moisture content, viscosity, and sediment disturbance [122–123]. Each property determined the extent of morphological retention based on the duration of exposure before burial [124]. Based on our observations, we can hypothesise how the tracks at Prince Charles’s Point formed in their particular environmental setting. The ~ 10 cm thick (but variable, and sometimes thicker) rippled sandstone which our sauropod tracks occur in are underlain by a hardened, desiccated surface (the bed 1-2 boundary horizon). Due to this, as hypothesised by [120; pp. 6], the downward forces of impressing a track would proximally displace and ripple the sediment outwards, with greater emphasis on a horizontal component, between and during the touch down and weight bearing phases of track impression (Fig 30). This horizontal component would be reinforced by reflected forces from the underlying hardened horizons. A shallow submersion component would emphasise this process and enable sediment to be displaced over a larger distance as no air gaps were present to resist. Eventually, the sediment would gradually displace upwards to form wide, shallowly mounded, consolidated displacement rims as seen on tracks such as PC-SA-2-85 and PC-SA-3-111 (Figs 24, 26). The widest widths of each generally occur laterally around the tracks, which suggests the autopodia were planted almost perpendicular to the substrate. The presence of mounded displacement rims further suggests that at the time of impression, the track-bearing surface was relatively firm sensu [122,125]. The sediment, however, was soft enough to be reworked as evidenced by subsequent ripples forming across uneroded mounded displacement rim surfaces. Blue arrows represent the downward forces exerted by the sauropod’s limb. Red arrows show the direction of displacement. Due to the desiccated (hardened) bed 1-2 boundary horizon and thinness of compliant bed 2 substrate, the horizontal component of sediment displacement was emphasised (black arrows). Blue arrows represent the downward forces exerted by the sauropod’s limb. Red arrows show the direction of displacement. Due to the desiccated (hardened) bed 1-2 boundary horizon and thinness of compliant bed 2 substrate, the horizontal component of sediment displacement was emphasised (black arrows). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g030 The resultant track formed as a shallow, concave impression with variable morphological retention. Based on track infills in the same relatively uneroded horizon viewed in the present-day, most are rounded, featureless impressions which could appear larger than the actual trackmaker autopodium. The morphological variation of tracks within individual trackways may indicate localised variation in sediment moisture content prior to burial sensu [58,120], especially with the presence of morphologies such as digits and pads in some tracks and not others. An absence of radial and desiccation cracks within or around the tracks suggests the lagoon margin surface at this time was constantly moist [46]. Based on this, the sauropods likely traversed a locally shallowly submerged lagoon margin surface with variable moisture content (Fig 31). (A) Tracks were impressed into a thin layer of fine-grained sand with variable moisture content. (B) The lagoonal water table increased and enabled further sediment to be quickly deposited on top of the track-bearing layer. (C) The fine-grained sand was overlaid by finer sediment deposited when water levels continued to increase. This would go on to become the bed 3 shale layer.

(D) Present-day exposure of the sauropod tracks, some with eroded displacement rims and uneven sediment infill. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319862.g031 After impression, the tracks would have become increasingly submerged by the shallow lagoonal body of water, indicated by ~ 5-8 cm long amplitude flow-directed ripples on the track-bearing surface (and displacement rims), and did not suffer uniform morphological degradation, i.e., a few tracks featured digits and pads while most did not. This implies that weak lagoonal currents alone could not have necessarily erased all track morphologies in the time between track impression and burial. This time was likely brief as the track-bearing surface lacked invertebrate bioturbation. Presently, the tracks appear infilled with sediment from an overlying layer, almost level with the surrounding track-bearing layer. Although raised, most displacement rims are affected by present-day erosion and are rarely seen as mounded structures. Due to their fine-grained composition, the sediments may have eroded at a similar rate to induce their unusually shallow appearance. Possible trackmaker identification Great Estuarine Group theropod and sauropod body fossils are scarce and often limited to isolated bones. Theropod bones include a middle caudal vertebra and several teeth [7,26–28]. For sauropods, several vertebra and teeth, and a humerus are known [23–25]. The humerus, previously identified as a femur, was affiliated with a cetiosaurid-type sauropod [23]. A similar scarcity of dinosaur body fossils has been observed across most European Middle Jurassic sediments [5]. Identifications based on these bones have been limited to vague higher-level taxa which may or may not necessarily correspond to the identity of the Prince Charles’s Point trackmakers. [76] suggested various possible trackmaker identities for their theropod tracks based on the trackmaker body proportions of appropriately spatiotemporally distributed large Middle Jurassic theropods. We used a similar approach due to a lack of comparable skeletal autopodia – typically lost during fossilisation [93]. For morphotype-1a, the relatively moderate average l/w ratios (1.43), 40°-55° digit ii-iv divarication angles, and presence of narrow, elongated ungual marks and padded, parallel sided, broad digits indicate a megalosaurid type theropod diagnosis sensu [75]. Based on the average morphotype-1a track length (46.3 cm), trackmakers possessed a ~ 1.85 m hip height. [126] suggested < 50 cm long tracks, represented by the Late Jurassic Megalosauripus transjuranicus, did not reflect trackmakers with body lengths < 5 m or > 7 m. We adopt this conclusion and suggest the following potential trackmakers. Megalosaurus bucklandii possessed a ~ 6 m total body length and was spatiotemporally widespread across what is now England during the Bathonian [127]. Duriavenator hesperis, also recorded in England, was similarly sized at ~ 7 m [128]. Both species were considered capable of registering < 50 cm long tracks with the morphologies of morphotype-1a and Megalosauripus isp. [75–76]. The specimens representing Magnosaurus nethercombensis (which possessed a ~ 1 m hip height [129]) and Cruxicheiros newmanorum (which likely produced larger > 50 cm tracks [130]), are subadults of uncertain ontogenetic status and may have grown to larger body sizes to become appropriate trackmakers. Regardless of potential species, megalosaurids are the only known theropod trackmakers which could impress large tridactyl footprints in the Late Bathonian of modern-day Britain [76,129]. We reach a similar conclusion for morphotype-1b-d. Morphotype-1d could have represented a juvenile megalosaurid, perhaps the same species as represented by morphotype-1a due to similarity in average metrics such as l/w ratios (1.46) and digit ii-iv divarication (56°). Alternatively, morphotype-1d could have represented an entirely different species with a ~ 1 m hip height. Possible English Middle Jurassic theropod trackmakers include Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis [131]. For morphotype-2, based on track characteristics, the known Skye body fossil record, and contemporary English taxa, we suggest a non-neosauropod or basal neosauropod species was likely present at Prince Charles’s Point, consistent with the interpretations of [37] for the Duntulm Formation sauropod tracks. On Skye, at least two sauropod species were present based on the differences in morphology between two teeth described by [24] and [25]. The best known sauropod postcranial element from Skye, an isolated 90 cm long near complete left humerus from the Valtos Sandstone Formation, was described as similar to the equivalent bone of the type cetiosaurid species, the Middle Jurassic Cetiosaurus oxoniensis, by [23]. Based on the average 51.7 cm pedal track length of morphotype-2, the Valtos humerus would likely proportionally fit within the estimated average trackmaker hip height of ~ 2.07 m. Determining possible affinities with wider English/European skeletal material is problematic due to the relative incompleteness of available autopodia. Cetiosaurus oxoniensis was widespread across England with a total body length up to 16 m, but its autopodia are only known from a handful of metatarsals and metacarpals, making it difficult to match the foot to tracks [132]. Other potential eusauropod trackmakers included the similarly aged Cardiodon [133]. However, trackmaker identification based on Cardiodon is highly uncertain as the species was erected based on a handful of teeth [133–134]. Currently, we consider the most plausible trackmaker to be Cetiosaurus or a similar basal eusauropod or potentially a basal neosauropod. Conclusion In the Kilmaluag Formation at Prince Charles’s Point, on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, we report and document 131 dinosaur tracks of Middle Jurassic age. These include tracks we hypothesised were made by a large megalosaurid and a non-neosauropod or basal neosauropod trackmaker. All traversed across a shallowly submerged lagoonal margin surface within a closed, ephemeral, freshwater (low salinity) lagoon palaeoenvironment, represented by a fine-grained rippled sandstone. The trackmakers consistently walked in non-uniform directions, which likely represented cumulative milling behaviour rather than interspecies or gregarious interactions. The occurrence of these tracks in a lagoonal shoreline provides further evidence to the widespread habitation of sauropods in these palaeoenvironments on ancient Skye, as indicated by previous discoveries, and suggests that theropods may have been more common components of the lagoonal assemblages than previously recognised.
